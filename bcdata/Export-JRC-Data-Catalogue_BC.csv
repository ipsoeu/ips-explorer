1;889;AIWT6-889;TrueBee (Digital forensics and blockchain technology against deceptive deepfake imaging in social media);https://www.trublo.eu/;The project (part of subcall of EU Project Troublo) intends to combine artificial intelligence tools for the recognition and classification of false images and a blockchain system to create a register, where the classification can be indelibly saved. This register must then be made accessible so that it can be consulted for any doubts in distinguishing real images from falsified images. The TrueBees project was among the winners (fifteen selected out of 90 applications from all over Europe) of the call launched by Trublo. Trublo is part of the European NGI (Next Generation Internet) initiative, funded under the Horizon 2020 program, to promote studies on how new technologies, and in particular blockchain, can revolutionize the media sector. Trublo supports the launch of industry research projects for the development of new software, platforms or tools. The term blockchain technologies indicates a set of traceability techniques that allow to retrace and reconstruct the processing chain, the life cycle of the multimedia data, through the traces left by the acquisition system, the encoding and re-encoding of the signal, but also to shed light on provenance, manipulation and sharing on social networks. ;Across Countries;Italy;IT;University of Trento;Academic-Research;General public services;General services.;In development;2021;;;Adjudication;Managing Copyright and IPR ;Blockchain;No;No;No;G2C;Smart city;Improved Public Service;;x;x;;x;Open Government Capabilities;FALSO;;;;;;;;Open government capabilities;X;;;https://www.ladige.it/tecnologia/2021/12/21/ecco-come-smascherare-le-foto-false-sui-social-un-progetto-all-universita-di-trento-1.3087750

Promotion of inclusivity in the city via a voucher system started in 1994. Up until 2013 vouchers were completely paper-based. In 2016 the voucher system in Groningen was moved to a blockchain, developed by DutchChain, a technology provider company. The core value-added of the blockchain-based system is the enhanced targeting of public money thanks to programmable money flows. Detailed spending conditions and eligibility criteria are programmed in the smart contract. Possible criteria include: detailed profiles of the beneficiaries and authorized providers, financial thresholds or usage limits. Smart vouchers can be used, for example, in sport clubs, cinemas or for subsidization of solar panels for home owners.

19;50008;IPSO-50008;i-Voting;https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/i-voting;i-Voting is a unique solution that simply and conveniently helps to engage people in the governance process. In 2005, Estonia became the first country in the world to hold nation-wide elections using this method, and in 2007, it made headlines as the first country to use i-Voting in parliamentary elections. Internet voting, or i-Voting, is a system that allows voters to cast their ballots from any internet-connected computer anywhere in the world. Completely unrelated to the electronic voting systems used elsewhere, which involve costly and problematic machinery, the Estonian solution is simple, elegant and secure. During a designated pre-voting period, the voter logs onto the system using an ID-card or Mobile-ID, and casts a ballot. The voter‚Äôs identity is removed from the ballot before it reaches the National Electoral Commission for counting, thereby ensuring anonymity. With any method of remote voting, including traditional postal ballots, the possibility of votes being forced or bought is a concern. Estonia‚Äôs solution was to allow voters to log on and vote as many times as they want during the pre-voting period. Since each vote cancels the last, a voter always has the option of changing his or her vote later. In the case of i-Voting, the cumulative time saved in the last Estonian elections was 11,000 working days.;National;Estonia;EE;E-Estonia;Central-Government;General public services;Executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs.;Implemented;2007;;;Public services and engagement;Governance and voting ;Blockchain;No;No;No;G2C;Governance and voting;Improved Public Service;;X;X;X;X;Open Government Capabilities;FALSO;;;;;;;;Open government capabilities;X;;;EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum - Initiatives Map

Currently, the permit application is submitted to the municipality, but must be checked by several authorities, such as the fire department or police to approve or deny the permit based on feasibility. All these control moments and advice are again collected by the municipality and then it is checked whether the event permit can be issued. With the Proof of Concept team and experts, the BAR organization tried to model this process on the blockchain automating standard procedures with smart contracts. An additional advantage is that all involved agencies are now also immediately aware of each other's advice and any objections, without intervention of the municipality.

There are still many questions open about the concept of digital identity. RvIG recently organized an internal blockchain workshop. One of the most appealing examples of 'identity in the blockchain' that came up was the do-it-yourself marriage. For the conclusion of a marriage, three parties are now needed: the two partners who decide to marry and the registrar of the civil registry who closes the marriage. The civil registrar's role is that of the 'third party that creates trust and can conclude the agreement after checking.' The nature of the blockchain means that this 'third party' is in some cases superfluous. In theory, this could also apply to a marriage: via the blockchain, the identity and intention of the two partners can be checked and verified via smart contracts and the decentralized databases. The marriage could thus be completed via the blockchain.;National;Netherlands;NL;Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (RvIG) Gemeente Zaanstad;Central-Government;General public services;General services.;Not in use anymore;2016;;;Public services and engagement;Authentication of self-sovereign Digital ID services;Blockchain;No;No;Yes;G2C;Self-sovereign digital identity;Improved Public Service;;X;X;X;;FALSO;FALSO;;;;;;;;FALSO;;;;EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum - Initiatives Map

By applying DLTs in the registration and payment processes for government grants and benefits, DWP will be better equipped to: (1) Prevent financial losses through fraud and error, (2) Support the most vulnerable citizens by offering them the benefits of full financial inclusion, (3) Support the achievement of the government‚Äôs wider policy objectives, especially getting people out of poverty in a sustainable way and (4) Offer good value for money and place public expenditure on a sustainable footing. A large number of welfare claimants are un- or under-banked and face barriers to greater financial inclusion such as credit checks, access to traditional financial products, and the costs of unauthorised transactions. DLTs offer a cheap and supportive means of getting these claimants into the benefits system. Digital identities could be confirmed through distributed ledgers running on securely-encoded devices ‚Äî or even through software on a mobile device ‚Äî which would allow end-users to receive benefits directly, at reduced transaction costs to banks or local authorities. This may allow them to become more fully included in the financial system through a secure distribution point that is more reliable than a bank account. Such a solution could also be linked with other systems to reduce the level of fraud and official error in the delivery of benefits, as identities would be more difficult to forge. Such activities may help to achieve one of the DWP‚Äôs principal policy objectives: to lift people sustainably out of the cycle of poverty and state dependence. Through the innovative application of such technologies, it would be possible ‚Äî with agreement from the benefit claimant in question ‚Äî to set rules at both the recipient and merchant ends of welfare transactions. This may present the opportunity for ministers to consider options for achieving better policy outcomes from the distribution of welfare support by agreeing or setting rules around the use of benefits.;National;United Kingdom;UK;Department of Work and Pensions;Central-Government;Social protection;General services.;In development;2016;;;Public services and engagement;Financial management and support ;Blockchain;No;No;Yes;G2C;Process digitalisation;Improved Public Service;;X;X;X;;Open Government Capabilities;FALSO;;;;;;;;Open government capabilities;X;;;EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum - Initiatives Map

If any of the organizations involved had an incentive to manipulate the attendance numbers, a paper attendee list is very susceptible to fraud. Blockchain technology can offer a solution to this problem with the?development of the Self Sovereign Attendance App. With this app, based on IOTA, people can check in on a decentralized blockchain, which is immutable, transparent and cryptographically protected, so that only the authorized parties can access and see attendee data.

166;200105;IPSO-200105;Cross-border micro-credentials;https://walt.id/case-studies/tampere-ktu;Universities do not have digital records for students especially for courses obtained across borders. This means that a large amount of manual work is needed. Tampere University in Finland & Kaunas University of Technology in Lithuania, are part of the university network ECIU, however, student accreditation such? as micro-credentials from courses (i.e. micro-modules or ECIU challenges) are not transferable between the two universities, making it very hard for students to take necessary courses abroad. Additionally, the current course accreditation system is missing any records of skills and/or achievements acquired by the students. Both universities are taking leading positions towards building micro-accreditations standards. With such semantic models, universities across the EU could easily and in the uniform manner exchange academic information. Although, even having agreed a common data model there is still a need for a network or infrastructure that would allow the delivery of credentials that everyone can trust by default and be certain that they are authentic and legally binding. Moreover, such data transfer should address GDPR and EIDAS requirements, and students need to have mobility and interoperability. That is how it was decided to participate in the E BSI Early adopters Multi-university pilot. EBSI not only provides a trusted network by using blockchain technology, but ensures GDPR and EIDAS compliance and has a governance framework agreed between all Member States that ensures trust and reliability. The project team decided to use ìSelf Sovereign Identityî or ìSSIî to create transferable and verifiable micro credentials for students of both universities. This user-centric solution will allow students to hold records of their obtained courses, share these records and to have them verified by the university in which theyíd like to enroll.;Across Countries;European Union;EU;The European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU);Academic-Research;Education;R&D education.;Pilot;2021;;;Public services and engagement;Authentication of self-sovereign Digital ID services;Blockchain;No;Yes;No;G2C;;Improved Public Service;;X;X;X;;#RIF!;FALSO;;;;;;;;FALSO;;;;https://walt.id/case-studies/tampere-ktu
