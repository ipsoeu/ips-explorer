8,Bobbi,Chatbot,https://service.berlin.de/chatbot/chatbot-bobbi-606279.php,,"As part of the  IDBB sub- project Virtual Citizen Assistant, the D115 call center employees of the State of Berlin are to be relieved of citizen-authority interaction and at the same time the provision of information for citizens is to be improved. This can be achieved either by automating the telephony itself (optimization of a channel) or by adding additional communication channels to telephony (multi-channel approach, hybrid approach). While personal contact with an employee is usually necessary for specific problem solving, the simple provision of information and forwarding of information can also be implemented via other, more automated, channels. We follow the suggestions for action recommended in the study “Uniform telephone numbers for authorities in the European Union” (IfG.CC, 2010) and formulate the project objective to increase the accessibility of D115 and to create expanded and combined access channels to information from authorities. In addition, the citizen assistant should use and promote the increasing digitalization of services of the Berlin administration. For this purpose, interfaces to services are integrated or created. As a result, the citizens will have convenient online access to the services of the Berlin administration.",Local,Germany,City of Berlin,Governmental,2019,Yes,,General public services,Information,Yes,No,Artificial Intelligence,In production,Unknown
