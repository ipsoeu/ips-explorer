# Welcome to the Innovative Public Services Explorer!

The Innovative Public Services Explorer (IPS-X) is an exercise to provide an integrated view of the public services using emerging and disruptive technologies, and to derive statistical data from them.

Service records are collected from voluntarily contributed data sources (e.g., surveys, catalogues, datasets), which are harmonised into a common data schema - nothing complicated, just a flat list of attributes, as the name and description of the service, the geographic area covered, its social and policy uptake (if any).

If you are interested in contributing, please follow the instructions outlined in the following section.

# How to contribute

Contributions must be submitted via pull requests (PR) to this repository. The data must be submitted as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, whose columns must have specific names and values. 

The submission steps are the following ones:

## Creating an issue describing your contribution

As a first step, you are recommended to open an issue providing a description of the data source and the services you would like to contribute. This would help understand whether your contribution is in scope with this work, and to verify which information has been collected for the services to be contributed.

## Preparing the files to be submitted

The submission consists of 2 CSV files:
- one describing the data source
- one describing the service records

The columns and values of these files must correspond to the ones defined in the data schema. Please note that all columns not matching the defined names will be ignored.

The `example` folder in this repository includes two empy CSV files with the standard column names. You can copy-paste the data there, and modify the column values (if needed) to match the allowed values.

## Creating a pull request

One the two CSV files are ready, you can create a pull request to the `src` folder.

The title and/or description of the pull request must include a reference to the issue you have previously created.

The two files to be submitted should ideally encoded in UTF-8, and they must have a file name following the pattern:
- `[N]-catalog-[name].csv`
- `[N]-services-[name].csv`

where "N" is an integer, and "name" is the abbreviation of your data source. 

Note that "N" and "name" should correspond to the same values in both files - e.g.:
- `1-catalog-jrc.csv`
- `1-services-jrc.csv`

The value of "N" must be incremental to the ones used in the already contributed data sources in folder `src`.
