Geographical extent,List,_admlevel,no,no,yes,"This layer defines the administrative level where the case is being deployed. This indicator follows the administrative tiers as identified by Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). It must be considered that some countries have 4 or 5 identified administrative tiers (and others 1-2), but we keep it at 3 levels. It mostly depends on the jurisdiction of the implementing authority:ÿCentral / National Government: Political authority of the administration extends over the entire country  ; Regional / Provincial: Political authority which takes place of a particular region in the country. This is bigger than local administrations and often are provinces or states (in a federal government system).  ;  Local: Political authority of a local sphere, such as municipalities. Please note that the Listes file also lists ?multiple countries? and university. Later in the study, multi countries implementations should have a specific indicator with the leading (first mover) being highlighted in the first row. Universities should be excluded fully ? we are targeting the use of AI in government ? not the development of them in universities. https://ipsoeu.github.io/taxonomy/organisation-category/2019",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Geographic coverage
Country",List,_country,yes,no,yes,"Only one country is admissible (the main one to which the case is referring to).  EU, EEA, EFTA, Schengen?countries. (Others?) as defined by ISO. This is the property highlighting the country where the initiative takes place. Obviously, there is some overlap here between the NUTS code and the country, but country level is very useful for distribution and quickly finding in which country the initiative takes place.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NUTS 2021",yes,no,yes,"The most precise?NUTSÿcode till level 2. This is a recent property introduced to assist in geographic analysis and searching to find some of the cases. Specific information on the location is only more crucial if the administrative level of the case is either provincial or local. There is no need to highlight e.g. the city of a ministry in case the administrative coverage is ?national?. Then, the country NUTS code is sufficient. ",link,,,,,,,,,,,
Responsible Organization,Text,,no,no,no,"The name of the organisation must be in English (with translation in original language) and must?be enough explanatory to identify precisely the organisation.ÿE.g.?""Government of Austria, department of?agriculture"".

It is the public organisation responsible for the case or that is using the case (in case for example of adoption of industry customized products). Often they are the same, but it is possible that a private company makes an AI tool for the public sector. Thus this is not the developing company of the AI tool and a public sector organization should be added in this column.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,

This isÿmore trickyÿto highlight as some of the cases could overlap with the secondary categorization.
