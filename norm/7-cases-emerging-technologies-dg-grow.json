Their plan for doing this involves setting up a system whereby invoices are automatically sent over the Peppol network to both the consumer and to DIFI, which stores them in a single database. The first step is to test this concept, through a first pilot due this year. The idea is that eventually this data can be used to help automate various parts of the procurement process. One initial hypotheses on how this could be done is automated categorisation of the product types that are being procured. It is thought that the data could also be used to provide input into the state budget.",

The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund matches job seekers with open positions using AI. It helps job seekers get matched with the right job. The current job matching algorithm is developed further with job seeker profiling algorithm.  Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board is using machine learning to detect land mowing. Satellite images are analysed to detect whether agricultural land has been mowed. This is necessary as mowing land is one of the requirements for receiving government grants. Before satellite image analysis this work was carried out manually using on-spot control.  In line with the Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia, the government encourages the use of AI applications and test projects. The aim is to have at least 50 use cases in public sector by 2020. Interestingly, Estonia has also launched a task force to collect ideas from the general public on how to best make use of AI for the development of Estonia's economy and state.",
