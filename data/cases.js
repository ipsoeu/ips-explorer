        "description": "As of 2020, the Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) makes use of algorithmic profiling of job seekers to increase the efficiency of its counseling process and the effectiveness of active labor market programs. Based on a statistical model of job seekers' prospects on the labor market, the system\u2014that has become known as the AMS algorithm\u2014is designed to classify clients of the AMS into three categories: those with high chances to find a job within half a year, those with mediocre prospects on the job market, and those clients with a bad outlook of employment in the next 2 years. Depending on the category a particular job seeker is classified under, they will be offered differing support in (re)entering the labor market  A coalition of civil society organizations started a campaign to rescind an algorithm used by Austria\u2019s employment agency. The system has been declared illegal by the Austrian data protection agency.",

In this way, the answers can be suggested more quickly, more adequately and also more 'automatically' to the answer provider, regardless of the chosen communication channel (oral or written). In essence, the project aims at two objectives: (1) the quicker and more efficient capturing and categorising of the question, and (2) the quicker and more efficient forwarding of the 'correctly captioned' question to the 'correct' answer provider with the 'correct' skills, whereby a valid and standardised answer (suggestion) is immediately sent along with it (so that the answer provider does not have to look up the intended answer script).",

        "description": "In 2015, the Estonian Health Insurance Fund started cooperating with the World Bank to develop and pilot a risk-based management model that would help increase the integration of health services. With risk-based management, GPs can identify patients with multiple chronic diseases on their list for whom additional prevention, counseling and monitoring would be most beneficial to their health and quality of life. If these patients are neglected by the GP teams, this can lead to serious problems, including unnecessary deterioration in health, which not only causes health damage but also unnecessary costs to the healthcare system (avoidable hospitalizations, duplication of examinations, etc.).The created solution finds the best algorithm for predicting which patients with selected diagnoses are likely to be hospitalized. In the solution, the EHIF database of medical bills first finds certain conditions \/ diagnoses to be included in the algorithm.",

Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses, cars, lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians, cyclists and like with a 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all.",

The goal for OuluBot is to become a virtual assistant in all everyday issues, whether they concern tourism, companies or city services. The answer or guidance to an electronic service should be provided regardless of time, place, medium and language. Technically, chatbot retrieves information e.g. relevant City of Oulu websites, chat history, guidance information, databases, and other information sources. OuluBot is available 24\/7 service. independent of working hours. If the user is looking for information that OuluBot would not be able to answer, then during office hours the discussion could be directed to the City of Oulu chat service (Oulu10 general counseling customer service).",

Two cities involved (Tampere and Turku) carried out well-being surveys among its student populations, and - based on its results - clustered the students into the groups in need of different support. The study has discovered that factors such as reliability of the public transportation, and quality of the natural environment plays an important role in students\u2019 well-being. Data retrieved from the study helped create a new cross-cutting public offering - a bot that would supply information about the topics that students found important. The uptake of the new service has been lackluster, leading the authorities to believe that only proactive marketing could change customers\u2019 behaviour. Also it has been concluded that in order to pursue such projects further, municipalities need to develop user experience awareness and data analytics skills.",

The authority began a three-month test of its software from French tech company Datakalab this week at the Chatelet-Les-Halles station in the heart of Paris, normally used by about 33 million passengers per year. Monitors will have access to a dashboard with the proportion of riders believed to be wearing masks. The plan was mask wearing mandatory in public transport from May 2019. The AI was regarded to be able to supplement enforcement agents in stations.

Result is up to 50% of calls were handled from start to finish by the voicebot,  70% of first-time applicants engaged by voicebot submitting their application, 75% of tax clearance holders were able to retrieve their tax clearance access number (TCAN).

It uses various risk indicators from existing governmental systems such as taxes, health insurance, residence, education and many more, to detect which addresses hold a higher risk of fraud or misuse of welfare benefits.  SyRi was developed in 2014 after multiple municipalities had been creating their own systems to detect fraud. The system does not make any decisions itself, but provides recommendations for civil servants to conduct further investigations. Various organisations have opposed the usage arguing it causes too many privacy infringements and is discriminatory towards the poor and vulnerable citizens. The lack of transparency on the inner working of the system and the inability of the people affected to get to know their data have been used, has been criticized as well. Following a court case, the Dutch court decided in early 2020 that the use of SyRi did not comply with Article 8 of the ECHR thus its usage has been cancelled.",

For this, Data Science for Social Good has been working with Rijkswaterstaat to create a machine learning model using data from incidents recorded between 2012 to 2016, road characteristics, speed and flow traffic data and weather data. The model predicts within a given time window and road segment the probability of an accident. Overlaying this on a heatmap we are able to display to traffic managers the road sections with the highest likelihood of accidents and allow them to better allocate inspectors to road sections to patrol. The solution gives a 3 to 4 times improvement on a baseline, where traffic inspectors patrol random road segments.",

Once users activate the app by entering a phone number and a code sent via SMS, they send a reference photo. Every so often the app sends an unscheduled request for a new photo to be sent within 20 minutes. The system checks both the person (using facial recognition) and the location, essentially replicating what would otherwise be a visit from a police officer. Non-quarantined people cannot sign up, as the app is connected to a database of telephone numbers belonging to those ordered into quarantine. The app also gives access to relevant health information and a hotline. The government intends to add more functionality to the app over time.",

This depends on how fast we will work out the technical aspects, so there is \"no time estimation for the complete implementation\" according o the local officials in Cluj-Napoca. The project is estimated to be completed within 30 months' period. Antonia has been launched in April 2018 and functions around the clock.",

The system has been put in place as it is argued that the state financial management must continue to digitize and electronic processes to make the processes easier for taxpayers. The introduction of automated chat in communication with their clients will also assist the call center staff, who save time and can thus deal with more complex issues of taxpayers.",

VeriPol exploits a combination of Natural Language Processing and machine learning classification algorithms, capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police reports.",

Various other Swedish municipalities are exploring how to implement the Trelleborg model to gain access to the same kinds of benefits. As a result of the automation process, the waiting time for citizens on their welfare applications has been significantly reduced. It has been mentioned that many case handling times for people in economically vulnerable situations has been reduced from 10 days to 1 day, with all financial assistance decisions done within 24 hours.

The robot is adopted by the recruitment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made their recruitment processes less biased. The Tengai robot is the result of a collaboration between the municipality staff and the AI consultancy Furhat Robotics. After the Tengai robot was released, within a week, it was decided to adopt its services permanently. Tengai firstly identify candidates with the highest general performance score, in order to make a shortlist for future selections. The robot then conducts the interviews to assess the candidates by analysing their behaviours, problem-solving capacities and other skills. If needed, the robot is able to ask follow-up questions. The interviews are then analysed, combined with the competency scores.  The recruiters of the municipality will conduct the final interview with candidates to assess their motivation. The first results following the adoption of the Tengai robot have been regarded as successful and brought significant media attention to the municipality due to the innovative approach to recruitment.",

        "description": "A predictive system called the \"Early Help Profiling System (EHPS)\" used in Hackney County (London), which uses data from a variety of different sources to identify children and families considered vulnerable and at risk of child abuse to the municipality. The data includes statistics from different government agencies, such as school attendance, housing information, economic indicators, and others. This allows early intervention to these families, avoiding the occurrence of a crisis with more expensive follow-up actions.  Each month, the social workers team gets a list of 20 families who are of high risk and unknown to the social workers at that time. Social workers then decide based on the information to conduct an early intervention, such as support from a child centre or a health assessment. It has been reported that the model had a high accuracy, with more than 80% of the risk alerts deemed valid, despite challenges with continuous updating of some data sources. The system was expected to help councils save around one million euro per year by having early, targeted interventions. However, the system was heavily criticized. The nature of the data collection and the risk assessment was very opaque as data is processed by a private company, leading to concerns by citizens. Those whose data was used were not informed and it was kept a secret which indicators were to determine the risks, since a private company was responsible for the development and argued that the information was commercially sensitive. Others noticed that the system was only put in place to cope with the austerity measures put in place, as the system was advertised to maximize payments from the Troubled Families programme. \nNow Hackney Council stopped working with the programme as it did not realise the expected benefits.",

The bureaucratic burden is increased by the fact that documents are requested at different places in a redundant manner and that there is usually (still) no electronic data exchange. Immediately after the birth, this creates additional work for many parents - in addition to the often tense domestic situation.\n\nThe guiding principle of the project is: \"The data runs, not the parents\". First, in 2018, a citizen-friendly, only three-page combination form was developed for entering all necessary data once. Thanks to a cross-institutional parents can hand it in directly at the maternity clinic, and the cooperation partners take care of everything else. take care of everything else. Parents now receive their child's birth certificate by post much faster. The parents now receive their child's birth certificate, the tax ID, the entry in the registration system and the child benefit notice much more quickly by post. The child benefit is transferred directly to their account. On this basis, an online service was service was developed in 2019, which will initially be offered as a pilot to a limited target group in June 2020. at the Asklepios Clinic in Altona. The pilot also includes the use of a voice assistance system to enable the combined application to be completed more easily and with fewer barriers. At stationary terminals in clinics or via tablets or smartphones, parents are guided linguistically through the process. guided through the process.

Machine Learning algorithm can support the doctor in the clinical evaluation and make suggestions in less time, analyzing much more information.  Clinicians in the diabetic, nephrology and internal medicine departments are called upon every day to make predictions based on the conditions of the patients being treated with respect to the time of discharge, the possibility of the onset of complications and consequent need for readmission, even urgent, to the facility. . They must, they needed to update the forecast every day for both patients in treatment and for those in protected discharge, to ensure that the facility was always able to provide assistance.",

        "description": "The Portuguese national health service is tax-funded, and otherwise mostly free of charge for the citizens. \nRegarding telephone triage, Portugal has a national free of charge helpline for emergencies (112) and a separate national health service contact center helpline for non-emergent situations (SNS24), at the cost of a local call. Originally established in 1999, SNS24 evolved into a multichannel contact centre with the mission to facilitate the citizen\u2019s access to the public healthcare services. Whilst providing several different services to callers, its core service is the nurse-led triage that uses protocols developed by the governmental public health agency. \nThe Triage, Counselling and Referral Service (TAE) is a telephone service provided by the Contact Centre of the National Health Service - SNS 24.\n\nIn 2018, more than 1 million calls with an average duration of 7-8 minutes were answered. Being of national scope, this is a service that promotes equity in the access to health care.\nTelephone service is provided by nurses and follows pre-defined clinical algorithms. Triage is based on a specific clinical algorithm (out of a set of 59), and the choice of the most appropriate algorithm is extremely important and relevant. \nThe selected clinical algorithm should ensure high safety (not failing to identify situations that require urgent medical contact) and should have high discriminatory capability.\n\nIn this context, the SNS24 Scout.AI will apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, aiming the development of decision support tools with two main objectives:\n1. Support the nurse in the selection of the most appropriate clinical algorithm.\n2. Provide support to Directorate-General of Health (DGS) in the optimization process of the design of clinical algorithms and their referrals.\n\nThe first objective will be achieved by identifying the most appropriate algorithms for a given set of symptoms, with adjustment for age and sex. The AI methodology to be applied will be based on a classifier built on automatic learning algorithms on an anonymised data set, obtained from contacts of the SNS 24 in 2017 and 2018. This data represents accumulated experience in around 2 million cases.\nAfter the creation of the prediction model, it will be implemented in the SNS 24 TAE Service as decision support, indicating in real time which algorithms are most likely to be used. \n\nThe second goal is to create a support tool in the process of optimising the design of clinical algorithms and their referrals.\nAdding to the data already mentioned the referral and its adequacy, as well as the diagnoses established at hospital level, it will be possible to:\n- assess the clinical performance of each referral, when classified in terms of safety and discriminatory capacity;\n- predict the impact of potential changes to algorithms in terms of safety and performance;\n- predict hospital-level diagnoses for each algorithm or set of symptoms.\n\nWith this analysis, it will also be possible to detect any anomalous patterns and allow the DGS to make more informed decisions supported by real world data.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques developed specifically for the Portuguese language will be used, as well as Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). The motto of the texts, the extraction of appointed entities and the creation of lists of bigrams and trigrams, as well as the association with international medical classification systems (International Classification of Diseases), using ontology mapping techniques will be carried out. At ML level, automatic classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and deep\nneural networks (e.g. bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms) will be developed. Statistical methodologies will also be applied to detect anomalous situations in the application of clinical algorithms and their referral. Therefore, the SNS24 Scout.AI project will automatically analyse the information recorded within the SNS 24 TAE Service, using a built-in classifier using ML techniques to help nurses select the most appropriate clinical algorithm. It will also support the optimisation of the design in the SNS 24 algorithms by analysing the results of the referral of each case, improving its discriminatory capacity and clinical safety.",

However, this process was both too labor intensive and at large intervals. So now AI interprets satellite images, and hard-to-judge areas are reviewed manually by inspectors.

The target of this subsidy are people who live in houses with a property value of no more than 200 000 euros. These people qualify for subsidies that can help them make their house more sustainable, ranging from 300 to 3000 euros. Allotment normally takes a lot of effort and time, because forms need to be scanned and judged. This process would take up to 6 weeks and cost a lot of manpower, which was often more costly than the subsidy in question. This project aims to optimize the existing process: it is an automation project. We started with a cluster data analysis to target the correct people for this subsidy. When these people apply for a subsidy, their application is examined by an algorithm. If the applications meets the qualifications, the subsidy is automatically awarded. The process is thus reduced from several weeks to a few days. This benefits the applicants, as the subsidy is only awarded after they have implemented the steps to make their house more sustainable. If the algorithm cannot award a subsidy, a human will be involved. This means that subsidies are never automatically rejected. In addition to innovative technical aspects, this case process was also innovative. We worked according to the \u201cgarage methodology\u201d, using funnels, scrum, and product owners. It cost time to implement this approach, but it works very well for implementing new technology.",

The idea, based on the results, is to expand to large and middel-sized Dutch municipalities. In doing so, IBM wants to always collaborate with local municipal debt relief organizations. Nationally, the project is executed in collaboration with several debt relief organizations. IBM sees this project as a way to make a social contribution with their own knowledge and technology, and has no profit motive in this project.

This tells them whether they are keeping their distance: a green smiley for more than 1.8 meters distance, an orange smiley for 1.5 to 1.8 meters distance, and a red smiley for less than 1.5 meters distance. Pedestrians are also warned with audio signals. The system does not save the photographs it takes, so images are used only for a direct warning to pedestrians. However, the total amount of pedestrians within range of the camera is recorded, so that it is possible to monitor whether a certain area is too busy. The 1.5 meter monitor is temporarily employed because of emergency ordinance COVID-19 and the necessity of keeping 1.5 meters distance.

        "description": "Support system for the classification of incidences\/complains from citizens in Barcelona. \nIRIS is the service that allows citizens to report incidents or send complaints to the Barcelona City Council for resolution. Through IRIS, citizens can send information and queries, as well as complaints and suggestions for improvement. In this process, the citizen who reports the incident has to classify it using a tree of topics offered through the computer application. This classification is important because it is used to direct the incident directly to the responsible department, thus speeding up the response process. Errors in the thematic classification cause inadequate responses and delays in the resolution of incidents, thus affecting the quality of the service offered.\nAs part of the IRIS service update project, a module called MARIO has been developed, based on machine learning algorithms -Machine Learning- and natural language processing (one of the technologies included in the IA) to simplify the incident classification process for citizens. From the analysis of the free text describing the incident, MARIO suggests to the citizen the most likely categories where the incident fits because he\/she chooses the most appropriate category.\nMARIO, which is currently being tested, minimizes the error rate in the initial classification of incidents by greatly reducing manual reclassification processes. Previously, 50% of the communications made needed to be reassigned; now, with MARIO, a hit rate of over 85% is being achieved.\nMARIO has been developed using open source tools -Open Source- such as Python, Scikit-*learn and *Pandas, among others. The algorithm has required a training that has been carried out using a dataset with the topics and questions asked by the citizen previously validated to ensure that they have been correctly classified.\nThis pilot has been used by the Municipal Institute of Informatics to evaluate the techniques and processes of text classification with the following conclusions:\nOften the integration of AI techniques into existing processes has to be accompanied by a restructuring of the data. In the case of IRIS, the wide range of classification options makes the task difficult for a human but makes *IA inefficient. Clustering of categories is recommended\n- It is important to have a quality dataset.\n- In order to ensure good system efficiency, good data preprocessing including cleaning and standardization of this data is necessary.\n- Data anonymization must be taken into account.\n- For good training, it is necessary to have a representative volume of input data that is homogeneous in all categories.",

This process is currently very difficult to carry out with the available tools, since it requires knowledge and forecasting of the consumption habits of the users. The new tool will be able to make such predictions, which together with the prediction of photovoltaic production (or any other renewable resource), will allow the calculation of optimized self-consumption scenarios. Thanks to this technology, users will also be able to adapt their consumption habits to promote self-consumption and, in the future, even offer service to the grid to promote its stability.\nThe tool is mainly composed of three modules: recruitment, planning and execution. Although AI will be used mainly in the third module, part of its results will also be used in phases one and two to help in system sizing and optimization, allowing the selection of the optimal number of PV panels. This will be done thanks to the automatic generation of statistical profiles according to the typologies of the users.",

Image classification\n-Google TensorFlow was used to classify images.\nA training dataset was created that was used to train the classifier model with TensorFlow. Using the trained model, it was possible to classify images into the following groups: advertisements, drawings, notes, pictures, paintings, maps or garbage.\n-The trained model was used to classify 50 000 images and its accuracy was about 70-75% when about 10 000 classified images were manually observed.\n-A graphical user interface was created that enabled an easier way to observe achieved results.",

However, the vast majority of patients still have their prostate removed, which causes discomforts or complications. The project will develop a solution that can assess the risk of the cancer spreading, ensuring the patient does not undergo unnecessary surgery. Based on data from previous disease patterns, the algorithm will assess the risk of the cancer spreading from the prostate. The result will support the medical assessment of which patients need surgery to avoid the formation of metastases and which patients can be exempted from surgical treatment.",

        "description": "With the implementation of Building Information Management (BIM) , which (generally) relates to virtual construction and digital collaboration between all project partners within a construction project, the Roads and Traffic Agency (AWV) of the Flemish government is fully focused on the evolution towards a data-driven organization. AWV thereby exploits to the maximum the possibilities of modern digital methods and technologies to collect, manage and use correct, complete and up-to-date information about its assets. The 'assets' are the road infrastructure objects that AWV manages, maintains and operates: roads, cycle paths, tunnels, bridges and all peripheral infrastructure. With BIM, AWV can efficiently collect and manage all available information about its assets during their entire lifecycle (study and design phase \/ construction and installation \/ management and maintenance \/ replacement or disposal) in a central database. By collecting the asset data once and exchanging it in a standardized way. In the (further) development of the OTL information model, correctly typing the objects and adding properties to each object type poses few practical problems. However, establishing relationships between object types is a lot more complex. As part of this PIO project, AWV is looking for a widely applicable relationship tool for creating and managing semantic relationships between assets, in accordance with the OTL. In this way, better and more complex analyzes can be performed on the asset data in the 'virtual' copy, which should allow AWV to manage its assets more efficiently, to exploit them more efficiently and (also) maintain them predictively.",

Via such a profile, the city of Antwerp wants to offer personalized recommendations to Antwerp culture lovers (tailor-made culture) at their own request and on the basis of their digital cultural DNA .The intended technological solution for SOCRATES is a Digital Experience Platform (DXP) that, as mentioned, is nourished by a personal culture profile and enriched with a wonder algorithm . The aim is to build the DXP in a modular way so that a maximum link with existing and future IT architecture, in particular the Antwerp City Platform as a Service (ACPaaS), is possible. ACPaaS offers a 'block box' of reusable (generic) backend services via engines so that (specific) frontend applications can be made faster, simpler and more powerful. The DXP intended with SOCRATES as an extension of ACPaaS extends this line to the application frontends, or all digital touchpoints with the (cultural) users.Based on the digital cultural profile of the user, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can make suggestions for, for example, literature and all kinds of cultural activities. The AI \u200b\u200balgorithms are specifically trained to 'amaze' the user ( serendipity ) with sufficient diversity in the cultural offer so that the user does not get stuck in his own protected information bubble (or filter bubble ).",

Lawyers are working to clarify this by harmonizing (coordinating) and bringing together (codifying) this fragmented legislation. But this does not yet solve the problem sufficiently. With the project 'Smart Regulations' we want to offer a solution by using Artificial Intelligence to train computers to interpret regulations. For example, computers can very accurately extract the correct information from those regulations for specific target groups (this can be people, applications or machines).  \nThe goal is therefore to be able to offer an 'engine' on unstructured information sources from legislation, regulations and decision-making that users can subscribe to in order to get data and additional insights from these information sources more quickly according to their needs.

Currently, the road lighting is controlled on the basis of historical traffic intensities and weather forecasts per province. However, local and real time data on traffic intensity and weather conditions are available. Through a combination of rule-based algorithms and machine learning, internal and external data sources can be integrated into the current system that controls the road lighting. AWV wishes to use this data to make a more accurate and location-based decision whether or not road lighting should be on on a specific road segment.

        "description": "On the sandbank De Paardenmarkt , located in the North Sea about 1.5 kilometers from the coast of Knokke, there are an estimated 35,000 tons of dumped ammunition (mainly) from WWI. It concerns both conventional and chemical ammunition. To date, there is no danger to the marine environment or public health, but there is an ongoing risk of the (chemical) munitions rusting through or tearing through (due to ship strikes), resulting in heavy (chemical) pollution. Moreover, the ammunition dump at De Paardenmarkt may in the future be an obstacle to coastal safety in general and to further developments around the port of Zeebrugge in particular. The Maritime Access department of the Department of Mobility and Public Works (MOW) of the Flemish government therefore wants to have a test carried out in the context of this PIO project that should demonstrate how this ammunition dump could be done safely and in a time and cost-effective way be cleaned up. The following topics are covered: precision detection of the position of the ammunition, continuous monitoring of the environment, removal of the overlying sediments, deepening of the ammunition and safe transport to the mainland with robot technology. The aim of the test is to locate a piece (or unit ) of ammunition a few meters below the seabed as precisely as possible within the larger ammunition dump and, regardless of the type or condition of the piece, to dig it up and bring it ashore (further disposal \/ processing of the collected ammunition is not part of the test). For this, the necessary survey systems and robot technology will have to be developed and \/ or tested that make it possible to reduce the risks to humans and the marine environment to a minimum. If successful, the tested solutions can be purchased and deployed for a full-scale clean-up operation.",

As part of the pilot, the Feelingstream application transcribed the Social Insurance Board's calls from May to August 2020 (3 months) in Estonian and Russian. The Feelingstream application provides an opportunity to get both a statistical overview and a detailed understanding of customers' concerns across several customer communication channels - calls, emails and chatbot. Customer contact analysis is the fastest and most immediate way to find places in services that the customer is in trouble with and that can be changed quickly. The analysis creates insights for managerial decision-making, which in turn leads to better and more efficient public services. The pilot project involved an information line manager and two service managers. In the pilot project, SKA chose Feelingstream as a partner, which specializes in analyzing customer contacts in Estonian and Russian.

The publisher monitors the quality of the texts translated as a result of the machine translation and, if necessary, corrects the errors in them, from which the machine translation learns and therefore the quality of the translation will improve in the future. The authentic text of the notice, which has legal significance, is in Estonian only. The introduction of machine translation in the Official Gazette was 80% funded by the European Commission.

The created solution is semi-automatic, based partly on machine learning algorithms, partly on visual inspection of remote sensing data and partly on third party software solutions. Remote sensing data are mainly used as source data, but forest notifications, soil maps and other data (incl. Teaching and validation data) are also input. As a result of the processing, all-Estonian map layers are completed for the most important assessment features, such as a raster map of tree vegetation tree species (for identification by main tree species).",

        "description": "This study focuses on the statistical characterization of ice conditions (extent, sea ice occurrence probability (SIOP), and length of ice season) in the Gulf of Riga, Baltic Sea, using remote-sensing data. The optical remote-sensing data with 250 m resolution acquired by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002\u20132011 were used for statistical characterization of sea ice. A method based on bimodal histogram analysis of remote-sensing reflectance data was developed to discriminate ice from water. In general, ice extent information obtained from MODIS data agrees with the official ice chart data (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and in situ measurements) and multi-sensor product containing data from microwave and infrared instruments (R\u00b2 >0.83). However, in case of severe winters and extremely mild winters there are differences in the dates when maximum ice extent is registered. MODIS data can be used for detailed analysis of ice extent in specific basins of Baltic Sea. Depending on the year, the ice season length in the Gulf of Riga ranged from 68 to 146 days, and the maximum ice extent varied greatly from 329 to 15,350 km\u00b2. SIOP and number of ice days increased significantly in areas where the depth is less than 15 m. Based on negative-degree days and ice cover characteristics (SIOP and ice season length), three winter scenarios were defined: severe (2003, 2006, 2010, and 2011), medium (2004 and 2005), and mild (2007, 2008, and 2009).",

        "description": "The National Heritage Board, together with pilot museums, will test the Artificial Intelligence of conservation and inventory Kratt S\u00e4ll, which will make museum inventories more convenient and faster. Today, it takes an average of 19 minutes for two people to make an inventory of one museum in the Museum Information System. For example, in a future shared repository or larger museums, inventorying a 2.5 million object will take 47.5 million minutes, or 90.3 years. This time is also the reason why it is often not possible to ensure the long-term preservation of all museum objects. One of the most important goals is to find a smart solution for controlling the condition and location of museums, based on the physical characteristics of each museum (eg material, age, condition) and the storage environment of the museum to determine the need and interval for inspections. If successful, this would allow time-consuming inventories to be abandoned in the future and replaced by needs-based controls. With the help of Kratt S\u00e4ll, we want to take inventories and condition surveys of museums to a new level. The use of krat changes the traditional and very time-consuming work step, giving the custodian the information they need to make decisions quickly. It predicts the aging processes of the museum and indicates objects that would need immediate preservation or rapid intervention.",

The preliminary application for the project was declared compliant by the State Information System Board. The National Heritage Board will start preparing the procurement in order to start the analysis and prototyping of the search in case of a positive decision. The project analyzes how museums can be described as kratt and creates a prototype called Folli, who is like a real museum worker, because Folli recognizes what is depicted in the picture and makes this information available to us. The prototype will be developed and tested in collaboration with pilot museums and volunteers. More than 10 Estonian museums have given up as pilot museums, and other memory institutions have also shown interest. The aim of the project is to take an important step towards automating the description of a museum. Image recognition has been practiced in both memory institutions and the private sector, but it is more about experiments or looking for solutions to individual questions (eg whether there is a man or a woman in the image). The analysis to be created must find answers to the questions of how to develop a chatbot that recognizes objects, activities and themes in images. However, the prototype can already find answers to some questions that need to be solved.",

As part of the pilot, the Feelingstream application Unemployment Insurance Fund transcribed calls from April to August 2019 (5 months).  The main reason for calling with the chosen type of support was related to the receipt of grants. From a human point of view, it is very clear why issues related to the receipt of money arise and the volume of calls is therefore significantly higher at the beginning of the month. Following the pilot project, work was carried out to improve e-environments and there were other findings that continued to work to improve the customer experience.",

        "contact": "",
        "description": "In response to the desire to improve road safety and vehicle traffic, the INZNAK project was proposed. This project aims to improve road traffic by developing and building a network of autonomous road signs. The use of intelligent road signs in road traffic will prevent the most common collisions on highways, resulting from speed not being adapted to weather conditions, the condition of the surface and damming? vehicles in the event of a need to brake suddenly. During the project, 3 types of signs will be developed: standing, hanging and mobile. Each sign will have a display that will present hints for drivers along with a suggested speed. Hints will be displayed in the form of text and image messages, which will warn or inform about current traffic disruptions. Thanks to the use of a string of signs placed along the road, drivers will be warned much faster about possible dangers on the road. This is due to the fact that each of the signs will communicate with the others, making it easier to manage traffic. The signs will communicate in LoraWan and LTE technology. LoraWan technology will enable the characters to communicate with each other. And LTE technology will be used to send and receive messages from the traffic control center. The use of two-level communication allows the solution to become independent from possible failures of the telecommunications infrastructure. To ensure the flow of up-to-date information to autonomous signs, it is necessary to equip them with a number of sensors, which will analyze the traffic in the vicinity of the sign on an ongoing basis. The experimental installations of intelligent signs will be equipped with sensors analyzing road traffic, such as: Doppler radar, lidar, acoustic probe, RGB camera, Bluetooth receiver. Due to the fact that changing weather conditions, such as: storms, blizzards, fog, black ice, are also a big risk on the road. A weather station will be installed in each sign, analyzing the current weather conditions around the sign. As a result, the resolution of weather measurements will be very high. The proposed approach to traffic analysis is based on the principles of multimodality, thanks to which it is possible to supplement each of the individual methods with a different one in a place where it better serves its purpose. Such a case can be observed e.g. at night, where standard vision cameras mainly capture car lights. The use of a lidar device in such conditions allows for proper detection of most vehicles. In the next chapter, individual modalities used in the conducted research will be presented.",

Thanks to iVoting, it is possible to create the electronic identity of citizens using advanced cryptology and blockchain. Municipal or municipal applications based on iVoting can be used by citizens to authenticate their computers and smartphones on several levels of security. IVoting protocols guarantee transparency and audibility of the voting procedure. Thanks to the applied cybernetics and cryptology, votes can be anonymous (secret) and public, depending on the type of vote. The system provides a strong level of security thanks to the use of a decentralized network of notaries' servers, which creates a trust machine that makes it virtually impossible to manipulate voting results. The application can be used for modern communication with feedback directly between the citizen and the local government administration. iVoting is great for use in local participatory budgets, local public opinion polling, electronic referenda or plebiscites, creating polls and public opinion polling, it can also be used for voting in various collegial bodies such as sessions, councils and local government committees.

        "description": "In November 2017, the office of the Secretary of State for Energy released some software, known as BOSCO, to companies providing electricity. The aim of BOSCO was to determine whether people were entitled to financial aid to help; them with their electricity bills. The reasoning behind the ADM was twofold. Firstly, that it would make the process much easier for aid applicants (although, this didn\u2019t seem to be the case judging by the large number of complaints the system received) and secondly, that it would also make the process easier and more efficient for the public utility companies.After receiving many reports that the software was not functioning properly, Civio, a Madrid-based non-profit investigative newsroom and citizen lobby, discovered that BOSCO was systematically denying aid to eligible applicants. Civio asked the government for the BOSCO source code to identify why those errors were happening. The request passed through three different ministries before ending up at the Committee for Transparency and Good Governance, which refused to share the code saying that it would violate copyright regulations (even though the software had been developed by the public administration itself).\nIn July 2019, Civio filed an administrative complaint arguing that the source code of any ADM system used by the public administration should be made public by default, in the same way that legal texts are made public. The case \u2013 which at the time of writing was ongoing \u2013 could end up at the Spanish Supreme Court, and could set a legal precedent.",

        "description": "In 2016, the local police of Rivas-Vaciamadrid, a town of 86,000 people in the Madrid region, ran a pilot of the Pred-Crime software, developed by Spanish company EuroCop (Europa Press, 2015). Pred-Crime analyzes historical data to predict where and when it\u2019s more likely that different types of common misdemeanors and offenses, like traffic violations and robberies, will be committed. Reportedly, the plan was to fully implement this software during 2016, but after testing it for nine months the municipality decided not to go on using it. EuroCop says on its website that it has dozens of municipalities from all over Spain among its customers, but it doesn\u2019t specify whether those local authorities are using its predictive software or any of the other non-predictive tools the company also markets. In another case of predictive policing, the Spanish police have reportedly been using software that analyzes the available data about the victim of a killing and the context of the crime, and then produces the likely profile of the killer. Between 2018 and 2019, agents of the office of the Secretary of State for Security have collaborated with the police by using such software in at least five investigations, according to a press report (P\u00e9rez Colom\u00e9, 2019b)",

        "description": "In January 2018, the regional Government of Catalonia started a pilot project to try and measure the impact among the public of its STEMcat\u2019s initiatives, a plan aimed at promoting scientific and technological vocations among young people.\n\nFor a month and a half, the Catalan government used Citibeats. This text-analysis software used machine-learning algorithms to collect and analyze around 12,000 tweets that spoke about the STEM disciplines in Catalonia. One of the insights the authorities said that they had gained was that women were more responsive to messages about natural sciences than about technology, according to the Catalan government\u2019s PR. The authorities then used that and other insights to \u201coptimize their strategy and propose new initiatives\u201d to make young people interested in the STEM disciplines. The project was part of SmartCAT, the Catalan government\u2019s strategy to become a smart region (as noted in this chapter, regional governments in Spain have a high degree of autonomy to develop their policies). The SmartCAT director said the software had allowed them \u201cto evaluate in a more objective way the impact of the (government\u2019s) initiatives\u201d to make people interested in science and technology.\n\nCitibeats, developed by Social Coin, a Barcelona-based start-up, was also used in December 2017 by the Barcelona municipality to gather people\u2019s attitudes towards public transport and mobility in the city by analyzing around 30,000 comments by more than 15,000 people. In a case study of this project, Citibeats spoke of \u201ccitizens as sensors\u201d.\n\nIn the two cases described above, and while the authorities praise the software\u2019s ability to gather and analyze thousands of online comments (something it would take much more time and money to do using traditional survey methods), it\u2019s not clear how representative those samples are and how valid the conclusions might be; and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any information on how those analyses then influenced public policy.\n\nSince March 2019, the regional government of Navarra has also been using the Citibeats software to detect online hate speech by analyzing text published on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nAs with other cases dealing with personal data, it\u2019s not clear how the software works and what oversight mechanisms the public authority may have in place when using it.",

One such example is the Smart Waste platform, which collects data from sensors installed in bins and trucks, and also from social media, surveys, the census, and satellite information. The combined data helps local authorities decide what services will be needed when and where. Smart Waste was developed by The Circular Lab (from the innovation center of Ecoembes) which is a non-profit organization charged with collecting plastic packaging, cans, cartons, paper, and cardboard packaging for recycling. Minsait, a division of Indra, a Spanish multinational transport, defense, and security technology consultancy company also helped develop the platform. During 2018, the Logro\u00f1o municipality and the La Rioja and Cantabria regional governments first ran the platform as a pilot and today it is available to local and regional authorities all over Spain.

According to the police, the goals of the system are as follows:\nTo aid. For instance, if a person with a backpack and wearing a blue coat has fled in a certain direction, this person can be found easily by the algorithm. The person is then traced on other cameras to get a more complete picture of the route he or she took and to detect crimes that might have been committed. The system can also help search for lost children and solve bicycle theft more easily.\nThe generation of live. For instance, at the beginning and end of the school day, trucks are not permitted to drive near schools. If a truck is spotted driving through an area it is not allowed to, the system sends an alert to the police.\nCollect statistical information to support\nThe system stores all \u2018objects\u2019 (for example: people, small and large vehicles, and animals) that appear in the video images. An algorithm then decides what category each object belongs to, and, after this first categorization, a sub-categorization is made. For example, when it comes to people, the system categorizes each person as either a man, woman, or child before further categorizing by clothing: short\/long sleeves, short\/long trousers, color of clothing, and things such as hats, handbags, backpacks, etc. The same system of categorization is used for vehicles. For example, if the vehicle has two wheels: Is it a bicycle or a motorcycle? For different vehicles: Is it a car, pick-up, van, truck, or a bus? In addition, the direction, size, and velocity of the object are also registered. The system is also able to implement face recognition (PZVlas, 2019), although, at the moment, there is no legal framework to regulate use by the police. However, as the spokesperson of the VLAS police zone indicated in an interview: in exceptional circumstances, when requested by an investigatory judge, it is possible to use face recognition",

        "description": "In many Belgian cities, there are problems when registering children for schools, especially when a lot of parents want to register their children at the same school. This has led to parents spending several nights in tents outside schools so that they can be the first to register their children. In response to this situation, which was considered unfair, several cities started organizing school registration via a central online system that uses an algorithm to decide in which school a child can be registered. In the system for primary schools, that is used in Leuven, a city east of Brussels, a number of variables are taken into account. On the basis of the answers given by the parents to a series of questions relating to the education level of the mother and whether or not the student receives a grant, students are then divided into \u2018indicator students\u2019 and \u2018non-indicator students\u2019. An indicator student is a student who is defined as having fewer life chances and is based upon the level of education of the mother and if the student is eligible for an education allowance. Further categorization happens on the basis of two criteria: distance from home to school and preference of school. The schools can decide how much weight they assign to distance and preference i.e. between 30%, 50%, or 70% for each (Meldjeaan, 2020). This weight can differ between cities, for instance, in Antwerp the schools have to assign a minimum of 50% to the distance criterium. For secondary schools, some cities also use an online registration system, which uses an algorithm to decide which school the child will go to. However, the system is not the same as for primary schools. As not every municipality has a secondary school, the distance criterium is considered discriminatory and, therefore, it is not taken up (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019). The system does take into account priority students (i.e., children of the staff of the school) and indicator-students (see above). The algorithm works randomly on the basis of the first choice in three rounds (Aanmelden school, 2020). As the system does not take distance into account, this has led to situations where students from Brussels took up places in Flemish secondary schools outside of Brussels, and children, living close to the school not getting in and having to be registered in schools much farther away (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019).",

        "description": "For years, and with varying degrees of success, the Danish government has tried to centralize and automate tax administration. Attempts to centralize and automate tax collection in 2005 with EFI (Et F\u00e6lles Inddrivelsessystem or One Shared Tax collection system) failed, and EFI was shelved in 2015 (Alfter, 2019, 51). A new system, to collect billions of Danish crowns owed by taxpayers, was expected to be finalized by mid-2019, however, in September 2019, the Auditors of the Danish Parliament, Rigsrevision, published a critical report indicating that tax collection would only be fully up and running by the end of 2020, or later (Rigsrevisionen, 2019).\n\nMissing out on collecting billions of Danish crowns in tax revenue, however, is just one of several automatization concerns on the table of every new minister of finance. One heated discussion is about automatizing the estimation of property values \u2013 particularly in a context where housing costs are growing significantly in the capital and near larger cities while they are dropping elsewhere, thus affecting property owners in a country where large parts of the population own their own home.\n\nPassed in 2017, the Ejendomsvurderingslov (law on property assessment, 2017) states that automatic real estate valuation assessment will become standard practice. In preparation for the law, this fully automated system was described as \u201cmachine assessments\u201d (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 36-37). The system is set to include \u201csales prices related to the neighborhood, location and size. Sales price levels are adjusted to take into account the distance to forests and recreation areas, schools, streets, railways\u201d. The system will also take into account whether or not there is the possibility to build on the surrounding terrain and whether or not ground pollution is an issue (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). A total of 19 parameters will be used to automatically calculate property value (Version2 Editorial, 2019). A preparatory committee prepared an analysis to guide the government ahead of the legislation. The committee followed the overall line to move from \u201csubjective to objective\u201d assessments, from human to digital assessments, and from manual to automatic administration, to improve assessments and lower administration costs (Engbergudvalget, 2014, p. 68-69). While it does not explicitly mention it, this model uses a level of machine learning to develop a \u201cstatistical predictive model\u201d (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). Furthermore, the overall assumption of the preparatory committee was that machine assessments were more objective than human assessments, where human assessments are considered subjective.\n\nAs with many other systems, the automated property assessment system has been significantly delayed. Along the way, fears surfaced that it did not comply with Danish administrative law (M\u00f8lsted, 2018). It also proved to be more expensive than the estimate in the initial report regarding the cost of a property valuation calculated by a human (Motzfeldt, 2019-2). This project, and other problematic attempts by the Danish tax authorities to incorporate IT projects, have been described as \u201cthe ministers\u2019 (\u2026) IT-phantoms\u201d (Version2 Editorial, 2019). The law to assess property values allows a variation of 40% in the value of a given property \u2013 20% either side of the price calculated by the system \u2013 \u201cand one does not need to hold a PhD in human behavior to predict that this will lead to protests if or when the system comes into use. Worst case we will see headlines that two newly built and identical houses will be taxed very differently. Could we blame citizens if they ask critical questions why they had to spend billions for a system with such a low level of precision\u201d (Motzfeldt, 2019-2).",

        "description": "You try to control me, I outsmart you. This was the logic of a Danish high school student who, in a post on Github, described how to disable a digital exam monitor (Schou, 2019). The move was part of massive protests by the students against The Digital Exam Monitor, developed by the Danish Ministry of Education (Den Digitale Pr\u00f8vevagt), and which was set to roll out in spring 2019. Following the protests against this surveillance, which included copies of the clipboard, active websites in four browsers, a key logger, a screen dump every minute, or whenever an active window changed, detection of virtual machines in the background, a list of all active programs, various unique IDs, etc.) (M\u00f8ller Kjemtrup, 2019), the ministry of education put the tool on hold (Undervisningsministeriet, 2019). Yet under the new social democrat government, students continue to ask the authorities to shelve it entirely (Mejlgaard, 2019). Meanwhile, another tool that uses machine learning to detect exam fraud has been developed at Copenhagen University. This move stirred new controversies and fears about student profiling in 2019. In 2014, high school software provider Macom supplied a tool called Lectio, which operated as an early detection system to trace students in danger of dropping out (Copenha- gen University, 2014). The tool was developed by university students and based upon information gathered through the administration and communication system used by 9 out of 10 Danish high schools, according to Macom and media reports. However, use of the algorithm was stopped about a week after it was introduced. The data used to develop it had been handed to a third party \u2013 the university and its master\u2019s students \u2013 without permission from the high schools (M\u00f8llerh\u00f8j, 2015). More recently, in May 2019, a group at the same department of Copenhagen University published a machine learning system by the name of Ghostwriter. The developers said that it could be used to trace the writing style of students in assignments and that it could detect with some certainty, whether or not a student had submitted a text written by someone else. The aim of Ghostwriter was to fight exam fraud, but (the university wrote in a press release) that the model could also be applied elsewhere to detect texts written in an unusual style (Copenhagen University, 2019). The machine learning was based upon 130,000 student assignments held in the Lectio system by Macom. The ensuing controversy between the high schools, the university professor, and the director of Macom focused on a breach of contract related to the handling of the students\u2019 data: \u201cWe feel unsafe when the data handling agreement is not respected,\u201d a representative of the high schools stated to online technology news website Version2, (Bang Frederiksen, 2019-1; Bang Frederiksen, 2019-2; Bang Frederiksen, 2019-3).",

        "description": "Since 2018, municipal governments in Estonia have been able to use a tool called The Youth Guarantee Support System (YGSS) (Mis on noortegarantii tugis\u00fcsteem? \u2013 T\u00f6\u00f6elu.ee o. J.). This tool helps case managers (social workers, child protection officers, youth workers, etc.) identify young people aged 16-26 who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). It is used to support them when they need to return to education or enter the labor market. Case managers of the Youth Guarantee Support System or the municipal government employees can see information about young people living in their specific locality. However, up until now, not all of the municipalities have joined the program. In order to join, the municipal governments have to send an application to the Municipal Government Information System for Social Services and Benefits (STAR). The case managers or municipal government employees are then shown a list in the STAR system of all the NEET youth who are registered as residents in a specific municipal area and who \u2013 according to other registry data \u2013 need help. This information is based on data from nine different registries, creating, therefore, a very comprehensive dataset that includes information on the young person\u2019s address, email, phone number, educational background, and if they studied in Estonian or Russian. Young people have the right to forbid the analysis by a case manager, and in cases where the data is processed, young people must give their consent.  The case manager then contacts the young people identified by the system and a letter or an SMS is sent to each person asking them to complete a survey. The Youth Guarantee Support System Request is automatically triggered twice a year (15.03 and 15.10).",

        "description": "In October 2019, the Japanese multinational IT service provider, Fujitsu, announced that it was developing an AI solution for South Karelia\u2019s social care and healthcare district (known by its Finnish acronym Eksote). The project employs machine learning methods with the aim of helping Eksote identify factors underlying social exclusion of young adults, as well as predicting associated risks. With the predictive model, social and healthcare professionals will be provided an overview of risk factors. According to Fujitsu\u2019s press release, the model identifies some 90% of young adults susceptible to social exclusion. In practical terms, the model that is being used is derived from pseudonymized data taken from the use of Eksote\u2019s services by young adults, and it uses this data to predict social exclusion outcomes defined by Eksote\u2019s professionals. According to Eksote, the legislation on the secondary and combined use of healthcare data makes it possible to use only non-identifiable, pseudonymized data. This means that Fujitsu\u2019s model cannot be used to identify individual young adults considered to be at risk of social exclusion; rather, the model produces a list of risk factors on a general level. The next step in the project is to examine whether it is possible, under the current legislation, to set up a consent-based system: a client\u2019s consent would be asked for before using the predictive model on their individual data when they, for example, have an appointment with a social care or healthcare professional.",

The aim was to identify problems early on, so that an intervention could be made and support provided to families sooner rather than later. Much like in the 2019 project on young adults and social exclusion, this model was based on explicitly defined undesired \u201cendpoints\u201d: low-grade averages, disciplinary interventions at school, high-class non-attendance figures, being taken into custody, acceptance into psychiatric care, and substance abuse. The model made use of data gathered from the IT systems of maternity clinics, kindergartens, schools, healthcare, and mental healthcare providers, as well as social services \u2013 e.g., it combined data from different administrative branches, namely social care, healthcare, and education. The outcome was the identification of a total of 1340 risk factors, ranging from bad teeth in children, to parents missing maternity clinic appointments, to the child\u2019s siblings bullying others at school. These examples also give an idea of the kinds of data that were employed when making predictions. Ideally, the model would make it possible to continuously keep track of risk factors of individual children.",

In order to comply with strict regulations related to data and child protection, software is used to blur images in police investigations on the police servers in Germany before they are uploaded to Microsoft servers in a non-identifiable way. In the cloud, algorithms analyze the images for pornographic content, identify the faces of victims and abusers and compare them to existing profiles stored in a database. These results are returned to the police for further analysis. This software aims to reduce the workload and mental strain police endure while investigating child abuse.",

The system is supposed to be used on inmates who are categorized at a medium to high suicide risk level and it is meant to substitute the current in-person checks carried out at 15-minute intervals, which have been criticized because they potentially increase the emotional strain on inmates.",

The agency has the ability to obtain all the data contained on the devices and run software on it. The software presents the employee with a limited overview of the content, which also includes language analysis of the text retrieved. According to the BAMF, both the software and the hardware was provided by the firm Atos SE, however, VICE Magazine found evidence,   that the mobile forensic technology firm MSAB was also involved. Another tool deployed by the BAMF aims to identify disguised dialects in speech. When an asylum seeker does not have a valid proof of ID, a two-minute voice recording of the person describing a picture in their mother tongue is analyzed by software, which then calculates a percentage of how close the speech comes to a certain dialect.",

Nevertheless, it is evident from the website that the project aims to use tools such as face extraction and matching, to correlate information from social media data, and to continuously initiate complex associative searches across all sources relevant to criminal investigation. A successful freedom of information request revealed that trial runs will be organized, including in Greece, involving end-users and practitioners, such as law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders. The Hellenic Police (Border Unit) is involved in trials that run between January and August 2020, while reports of trial runs and tests are expected in the form of deliverables in April 2020 and January 2021.

The approach starts from the assumption that only the combination of different expertise and different tools in coherent and integrated pipelines can offer effective results in a short time. For this reason, the teams of each \"sub-project\" are interdisciplinary and the individual sub-projects also constitute autonomous projects from a scientific and operational point of view. Precisely the idea that the advancement of knowledge with its applicative implications offers pieces to be organized modularly in multiple ways has convinced us to organize the work in building-blocks projects. The ambitions are multiple and transversal: from the attempt to \"export\" knowledge, techniques, and solutions across disciplines (for example from omics to legal data mining) to the combination of protocols and software to automate the pseudonymization of texts or to the creation of innovative tools for querying legal materials through their automatic annotation to the construction of prediction tools based on data science and Intelligence Artificial, to the attempt to offer understandable explanations on the functioning of the tools produced \/ used adapting them to the needs \/ capabilities of the different end users. \u200e \u200eAll these steps are obviously articulated in full coherence with the corresponding regulatory and ethical framework, convinced that the regulatory and ethical profiles in research are central and go beyond mere adherence to the rules. \u200e",

Law information website Altalex reports that the system\u2019s accuracy is 87-93% in Naples, 92-93% in Venice, and 94% in Prato, but, at the moment, no independent auditing or fact-checking is publicly available for each of these trials. \nXLAW is software that uses probabilistic, machine learning-powered solution for trends and pattern discovery in crimes. This implies that one can deduce \u2014 or more accurately, induce \u2014 how criminal behavior will unfold, before it has happened, by intelligent analysis of the criminal history of a location over time. Lombardo claims to have done this by carefully analyzing 20 years of data and also by calling on his experience in the field. As a result, thanks to XLAW, law enforcement officials can be alerted and deployed on the scene before a crime has even happened. At the same time, XLAW provides police officers with details as precise as \u201cgenre, height, citizenship, distinguishing features, and biometrics\u201d of a potential suspect.XLAW has a strong predictive component to it. In the case of Venice, for example, State Police boasted that \u201c84% of felonies (\u201cfatti-reato\u201d) that have been either attempted or committed had been foreseen by the system\u201d.

The system consists of many connected databases (Ministry of Public Administration, 2009) and was designed to optimize the work process for social workers, evaluate their work, and prevent errors when processing applications for social welfare. The system has been upgraded since its introduction and that it now includes AI, ADM, and machine learning capabilities.\n\nFor example, citizens can use ADM to learn their social rights and see a prediction of benefit payments so that they can make an informed evaluation and calculation before applying for social benefits. Furthermore, the application processes for several social rights\/benefits is fully automated, e.g., to research previous decisions related to social benefits and to see new (informative) ones for particular applicants. E-sociala can also detect people from the same family and access their financial information, thereby simplifying the process for social workers.\n\nThe goal is to further automate the process so that the system can create a full \u201csocial rights profile\u201d for every applicant. The system will then be able to see what benefits a particular citizen is eligible for, for how long, and for what amount of money. For legal reasons, social workers still need to personally evaluate, print, sign and send every application. At the moment, the process still requires some manual (human) intervention which is recorded and analyzed in order to improve the system and prevent errors.",

The system was designed to monitor pupils\u2019 grades and absences, to search for specific learning patterns, and help teachers find \u201cproblematic\u201d pupils. However, the system has been critized. The educational experts were  critical of the methodology and they claimed that grades and absences by themselves were not sufficient indicators to reliably detect learning problems. In addition, the budget was too small, and thus researchers had to use interpolated data and take other shortcuts. The public debate also addressed another related issue: that a lot of school data is collected and owned by a private (commercial) contractor - which has a de facto monopoly on AI development in education.",

The Council developed the system by buying an IBM product called iBase. The approach to using the system has been internally developed. It is noted that the aim is to empower \u2018lead professionals to make the best use of data they are legally able to see, and is not about replacing decision making or interpretation with system algorithms or decisions\u2019. The stated aim is to enable a more \u2018holistic\u2019 understanding of people, needs and services. Future goals include developing decision making tools, building performance reporting tools, building threshold and alerting tools and rolling the system out to more users, as well as connecting more data.",

        "description": "In this project we propose a neural network-based document clustering system, which is a genuine contentaddressable memory system, meaning it clusters and stores text documents so they can be retrieved based on their content. Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM\u2019s), documents are mapped as points on a semantic map, in a topological order that describes the similarity of their contents. This map is then used as a metaphor to interact with the text corpus, creating an interactive visual analytics tool, allowing for its exploration through different, but correlated views and iteratively selecting and examining document",

A dataset from a higher education institution is used to build classification models to predict academic performance of students. The dataset includes information known at the time of student\u2019s enrollment \u2013 academic path, demographics and social-economic factors. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there\u2019s a strong imbalance towards one of the classes. Algorithms to promote class balancing with synthetic oversampling are tested, and classification models are trained and evaluated, both with standard machine learning algorithms and state of the art boosting algorithms. Our results show that boosting algorithms respond better to the specific classification task than standard methods. However, even these state of the art algorithms fall short in correctly identifying the majority of cases in one of the minority classes. Future directions of this study include the addition of information regarding student\u2019s first year performance, such as academic grades from the first academic semesters.",

Operational productivity of IPST is crucial for the blood supply chain in Portugal since it monitors the quality and safety of donation, procurement, processing, storage, preservation and distribution of human blood, blood components, organs, tissues and human origin cells. The goal of LAIfeBlood project is to provide IPST with new tools to improve the efficiency of blood supply operations in Portugal. LAIfeBlood project is particularly focused on: (1) extracting temporal and geographical patterns from historical collection and transfusion data; (2) developing predictive models for the expected collections and transfusions in different temporal and geographic areas; and (3) developing software tools to optimize the planning of collections at the national level according to the availability of IPST teams and resources and collection events. LAIfeBlood project tackles an important societal challenge of maximizing blood services effectiveness while minimizing wastage of an increasingly scarce resource and optimizing the efficiency of blood supply operations. We expect our results to be used to derive implementable policies at IPST to plan collections and manage the daily inventory rebalancing problem, as well as contributing to the development in the field of optimization and dynamic supply chain management.",

Inspired by Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, it establishes that the flow of mobility between two places, for example two neighborhoods of a city, is proportional to their population and inversely proportional to their geographical distance.In practice, the gravitational model is often inaccurate because it is based on only two variables, distance and population, and is unable to capture complex relationships between them.\nThe Institute of Science and Information Technologies of the National Research Council (Cnr-Isti) together with the Bruno Kessler Foundation of Trento and the Argonne National Laboratory in the USA, has developed \"Deep Gravity\", an algorithm that adds to the gravitational model two fundamental ingredients, namely: the use of different variables that describe the points of interest in a place such as restaurants, hotels, hospitals and streets, and the ability to capture complex relationships between these variables thanks to the use of deep learning.",

To reduce the impact of future forest fires, SAFERS will develop a new Big Data platform coupled with new information systems based on Artificial Intelligence, using many data sources, in particular the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. In addition to satellite data, the project will also analyse in real time data from ad hoc monitoring cameras, social media as well as mobile phones of professional users, volunteers and citizens who, through chatbots, may report the situation they are observing.",

In addition, other added values are improved road surface quality, increased infrastructural competitiveness of an region for investment, insights on travel and tourism patterns, reduced impact of road works on citizens in the form of downtime and congestion, savings in agency costs by the public administration and lower road user costs for citizens and infrastructure users.\nThe cloud-based solution can potentially be used by other public administrations in Europe, since the problem described is common to all public administrations.",

The user who uses the voice assistant is identified, on a one-off basis, through the connection between the Amazon user and the digital identity (eg: SPID). This identification operation is carried out only once and is valid until explicit revocation. When the user activates the application with \"Alexa, speak with Torino certificates\", the user is recognized, the e-mail address that will be used for delivery is remembered (the one defined in the Amazon profile), and is asked to confirm the certificate request.

Most of these objectives could not have been achieved without the development of new technology to automate drug storage and dispensing and the digitalization of all processes, from prescriptions to checking adherence within the project of reforming the HUMS outpatient pharmacy unit.  Different innovations have been implemented: an electronic prescription platform (integrated with the health systems in use at the HUMS), a patient appointment system, a robot for automatic storage and dispensing in assisted and unassisted mode, a full traceability system for the entire drug management process, primary and secondary adherence records system, improvements to the website, an application (app) and a contact and information system in the dispensing area to facilitate communication with patients.",

        "description": "The eHealth technology (a wristwatch and app with which the whereabouts of the patients can be traced) is used to provide elderly people with Alzheimer more freedom. The technology enables the nurses and the institution to trace the elderly better, thus giving them more freedom to move around. The technology fits in a policy of the organisation to work with life cycles. This means that a team decides how much freedom a specific patient can have. The aim is to grant as much freedom as possible, given the patient health and mental situation. If people can move around more, they stay fit longer both physically and mentally, the organisation argues. The organisation also emphasizes that the ICT tool is above all a supportive tool and that the most important element still is the (risk) assessment of the patient.\nThe eHealth innovation was an example of how such technologies can support health professionals, as personal health data is collected, stored and communicated between relevant stakeholders. In general, in health technology, patient data is used to provide more precise and personalized health care (e.g. personalized interventions, predicating and preventing diseases). In this specific case of health technology, a mobile device, mobile sensor, and wearables were used to increase the health and wellbeing of users. This device with sensor technology helps Alzheimer patients to walk around more freely again in a nursing home and outside the nursing home through GPS tracking, which would otherwise be impossible for those suffering from dementia. In that sense, the ICT technology is important and vital for the innovation.",

The innovation was created due to the difficulty in exploring the visual function (e.g. vision) among children, but it can be used for both collaborative and non-collaborative patients (i.e. patients who are able to collaborate with physicians as opposed to patients \u2013 such as children \u2013 who are unable to collaborate with physicians). The partnership allows technology to be shared between organisations and combines their experience in the health and technological fields. The innovation in this project consists of the development of a specific app that uses AI in a Huawei P30 mobile phone in order to analyse data from visual explorations using the DIVE-Medical device. This innovation helps physicians to determine whether or not a patient has a visual impairment by comparing patient gaze patterns with the database generated by previous diagnoses (which can be accessed online and offline). In some cases, it also makes it possible to estimate the probability of a particular pathology. The project is focused on non-collaborative patients, but it can also be used in collaborative patients (i.e. patients that are able to collaborate with physicians as opposed to patients \u2013 such as children \u2013 who are unable to collaborate with physicians).",

The platform allows the collection, analysis, aggregation and display of data extracted from different sources. This is possible thanks to the construction of the platform on three different levels (layers): the Data layer, the Analysis layer and the Visualization layer.\nThe Data layer constantly collects raw data from the web and social media, pre-processes them through an initial screening and an initial cleaning of the raw data, obtained through the relative Application Programmer Interface, API: Twitter API, Reddit API, Google Trends API. To collect the data, keyword filters were used, created and validated through a structured framework, on the basis of recurrence and relevance criteria (6).\nThe Analysis layer has the function of analyzing the processed and cleaned data through the generation of graphs, thus making the extracted data understandable and relating them to each other. The processes that allow the geolocalization of tweets take place on this layer, and two processes based on machine learning algorithms: Influencer analysis and Early-signal detection:\nInfluencer analysis makes it possible to identify the most influential and most active users in the conversation about vaccines on Twitter, with the aim of monitoring the crucial \"nodes\" of the communities involved, both in vaccine-friendly communities and in the no vax community;\nEarly-signal detection allows the interception of users who use new hashtags, therefore users new to the topic of vaccines. The hashtag (created by inserting the # key in front of the desired word or phrase, for example, #vaccini or #iononmivaccino) is a tool that serves as a thematic aggregator on some social networks and was introduced by Twitter as a keyword signal and to draw users' attention to some particular words or themes.\nFinally, the Visualization layer allows the visualization of the results, makes the extrapolated information understandable and communicates it in a simple but representative way, in order to understand the displayed data more easily.",

        "description": "The MIREL project will create an international and inter-sectorial network to define a formal framework and to develop tools for MIning and REasoning with Legal texts, with the aim of translating these legal texts into formal representations that can be used for querying norms, compliance checking, and decision support.\nMIREL addresses both conceptual challenges, such as the role of legal interpretation in mining and reasoning, and computational challenges, such as the handling of big legal data, and the complexity of regulatory compliance. It bridges the gap between the community working on legal ontologies and NLP parsers and the community working on reasoning methods and formal logic. Moreover, it is the first project of its kind to involve industrial partners in the future development of innovative products and services in legal reasoning and their deployment in the market.\nMIREL promotes mobility and staff exchange between SMEs to academies in order to create an inter-continental interdisciplinary consortium in Law and Artificial Intelligence areas including Natural Language Processing, Computational Ontologies, Argumentation, and Logic & Reasoning.",

The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund matches job seekers with open positions using AI. It helps job seekers get matched with the right job. The current job matching algorithm is developed further with job seeker profiling algorithm.  Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board is using machine learning to detect land mowing. Satellite images are analysed to detect whether agricultural land has been mowed. This is necessary as mowing land is one of the requirements for receiving government grants. Before satellite image analysis this work was carried out manually using on-spot control.  In line with the Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia, the government encourages the use of AI applications and test projects. The aim is to have at least 50 use cases in public sector by 2020. Interestingly, Estonia has also launched a task force to collect ideas from the general public on how to best make use of AI for the development of Estonia's economy and state.",

        "description": "Amsterdam has limited living space; both for citizens and visitors. If a citizen wants to rent out their home or houseboat to tourists, they need to meet certain requirements. For example, they can do so for a maximum of 30 nights per year and a maximum of 4 people at a time. They must also report it to the municipality. Not everyone adheres to those conditions. The municipality sometimes receives reports, for instance from neighbours or rental platforms, who suspect that a home has been rented out without meeting those requirements. If such a report is filed, employees of the department of Surveillance & Enforcement can start an investigation. From 1 July 2020, a pilot will be carried out for six months with an algorithm that supports the employees of the department of Surveillance & Enforcement in their investigation of the reports made concerning possible illegal holiday rentals. The algorithm helps prioritize the reports so that the limited enforcement capacity can be used efficiently and effectively. By analyzing the data of related housing fraud cases of the past 5 years, it calculates the probability of an illegal holiday rental situation on the reported address.",

A dangerous traffic situation or disturbance from people or cafes can also be reported. This system used to be a collection of drop-down menus, from which the user would pick the category that best suited their report. The department responsible for a certain category would then take care of the report. However, as the municipality is a complex organisation, there are countless categories. Many times the wrong category would be chosen, resulting in delays. Now, an algorithm recognizes certain keywords, for example, waste and sidewalk. From these keywords, it determines which category it belongs to, and ultimately, which department within the municipality should examine the case. As a result, there are fewer administrative steps for the person reporting on the issue. Also, the report can be processed much faster, because it arrives at the right department more quickly.",

This can be achieved either by automating the telephony itself (optimization of a channel) or by adding additional communication channels to telephony (multi-channel approach, hybrid approach). While personal contact with an employee is usually necessary for specific problem solving, the simple provision of information and forwarding of information can also be implemented via other, more automated, channels. We follow the suggestions for action recommended in the study Uniform telephone numbers for authorities in the European Union (IfG.CC, 2010) and formulate the project objective to increase the accessibility of D115 and to create expanded and combined access channels to information from authorities. In addition, the citizen assistant should use and promote the increasing digitalization of services of the Berlin administration. For this purpose, interfaces to services are integrated or created.

Data about local services and migrants will feed user-friendly tools for employability and career guidance, whilst assessing supply and demand of migrants skills. The platform will also focus on the social, educational and cultural needs of migrants and how these fit to existing services offered by local hosts. Overall, the system will allow public authorities and guidance professionals to offer a personalised service to migrants based on real needs and the opportunities available to them. The NADINE system will be based around two key banks of a data repository of information about host societies and migrants from which a range of services will be produced.

        "description": "Limerick City and County Council operate the Housing Assistance Payment Shared Service Centre (HAP SSC) on behalf of the local government sector and are continuously striving for ways to improve their business. The organisation deals with more than 47,000 tenancies and 27,000 landlords, makes payments in excess of 400million, and collects more than 100million in rents. By 2021 it is anticipated that the HAP SSC will deal with 80,000 tenancies, 55,000 landlords and 600million in payments. In order to help deal with these volumes, the deployment of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the HAP Shared Service Centre was investigated. During 2018 a proof of concept pilot project was carried out by Agilisys, examining 3 micro processes within the centre. The proof of concept project demonstrated that opportunities for efficiencies and savings can be achieved through the deployment of RPA. Applying the outcome of the proof of concept project to a business case, it was concluded that if 10 complex processes could be replaced by RPA, then considerable savings could be made, while at the same time improving services to all key stakeholders. The HAP SSC is now seeking to identify existing processes where RPA may be immediately deployed, as well as opportunities for further business systems integration and automation within the HAP SSC.",

The clustering model grouped MOT centres based on the behaviour they show when conducting MOT tests.\nThe DVSA created a risk score for each garage in Great Britain. The risk score combined the output of the clustering algorithm with historical data about how frequently garages had been disciplined for not applying correct MOT standards. This allowed the DVSA to rank garages and their testers, and helped the DVSA identify regional trends. The DVSA updated their garage test data every 3 months. This allowed the DVSA to ensure the model used fresh data whilst also providing stability to garage ratings, providing examiners 3 month windows with which to visit garages.",

Authorities in the city want to address the health and safety concerns of residents and visitors enduring excessive noise from modified exhaust systems on cars, motorbikes and other vehicles travelling on the Stalenstraat.\nNokia is deploying its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Scene Analytics technology for the proof-of-concept project. The solution utilises data from microphones and installed cameras, used as IoT sensors along the road. If an approaching vehicle exceeds the pre-determined threshold, the street-deployed microphones and cameras begin recording.\nNokia Scene Analytics adds intelligence to the event data transmitted from the sensors using a decibel-powered algorithm for audio analysis and automated number plate recognition (ANPR). This information is sent to authorities who receive quantified observations and orientations in order to make informed decisions on \u2018if\u2019 and \u2019how\u2019 they will address the issue.",

Trublo supports the launch of industry research projects for the development of new software, platforms or tools. The term blockchain technologies indicates a set of traceability techniques that allow to retrace and reconstruct the processing chain, the life cycle of the multimedia data, through the traces left by the acquisition system, the encoding and re-encoding of the signal, but also to shed light on provenance, manipulation and sharing on social networks.",

Promotion of inclusivity in the city via a voucher system started in 1994. Up until 2013 vouchers were completely paper-based. In 2016 the voucher system in Groningen was moved to a blockchain, developed by DutchChain, a technology provider company. The core value-added of the blockchain-based system is the enhanced targeting of public money thanks to programmable money flows. Detailed spending conditions and eligibility criteria are programmed in the smart contract. Possible criteria include: detailed profiles of the beneficiaries and authorized providers, financial thresholds or usage limits. Smart vouchers can be used, for example, in sport clubs, cinemas or for subsidization of solar panels for home owners. From the municipality perspective Stadjerspas ensures that public money reserved for a specified purpose is spent exclusively on that purpose and targeted at a desired group of beneficiaries.",

In 2005, Estonia became the first country in the world to hold nation-wide elections using this method, and in 2007, it made headlines as the first country to use i-Voting in parliamentary elections. Internet voting, or i-Voting, is a system that allows voters to cast their ballots from any internet-connected computer anywhere in the world. Completely unrelated to the electronic voting systems used elsewhere, which involve costly and problematic machinery, the Estonian solution is simple, elegant and secure. During a designated pre-voting period, the voter logs onto the system using an ID-card or Mobile-ID, and casts a ballot. The voter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s identity is removed from the ballot before it reaches the National Electoral Commission for counting, thereby ensuring anonymity. With any method of remote voting, including traditional postal ballots, the possibility of votes being forced or bought is a concern. Estonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution was to allow voters to log on and vote as many times as they want during the pre-voting period. Since each vote cancels the last, a voter always has the option of changing his or her vote later. In the case of i-Voting, the cumulative time saved in the last Estonian elections was 11,000 working days.",

A particular advantage of Blockchain in relation to digital identity could be that it becomes easier to share specific information only in a specific context. Furthermore, each citizen would have control over which data he would share with whom (for obvious reasons, the exceptions can be made for governmental organisations). Going back to the age control, the owner of a shop only needs to know that the person in front of him is older than 18 years old, but currently (has to) ask for a document containing more data.",

        "description": "In this second round of blockchain Proof of Concepts with the government, we looked at and co-designed with a Proof of Concept from the municipality of Eindhoven. The Department does not only register ownership of real estate, but also registers and provides geo-information data. Sometimes the data is used in the wrong context, or an outdated set is accidentally used. By applying the blockchain, the Kadaster can immediately specify the most up-to-date dataset by means of a timestamp. It can then be used when filling in a form for environmental law requirements as well as other use cases. All participants can then establish that the data is up-to-date and correct. Providing these open data sets within the blockchain is not a very complicated process, but is therefore suitable to use to build a first blockchain prototype. The Kadaster is also researching work from other countries that are already experimenting with the blockchain and is looking to apply certain elements in the Netherlands.",

        "description": "The municipalities of Barendrecht, Albrandswaard and Ridderkerk's BAR Organization looked into ways in which they could apply blockchain to various permitting processes such as street parties. The BAR organization looked at small-scale events where someone applies for a license for a street party. Currently, the permit application is submitted to the municipality, but must be checked by several authorities, such as the fire department or police to approve or deny the permit based on feasibility. All these control moments and advice are again collected by the municipality and then it is checked whether the event permit can be issued. With the Proof of Concept team and experts, the BAR organization tried to model this process on the blockchain automating standard procedures with smart contracts. An additional advantage is that all involved agencies are now also immediately aware of each other's advice and any objections, without intervention of the municipality. Both matters mean a huge reduction in the burden on the work within the municipality. Everything can be done faster and the procedure becomes less vulnerable because a large part of the communication is no longer necessary.",

        "description": "Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (RvIG) is investigating how digital identity can be implemented on blockchains for Dutch citizens According to RvIG, a reliable, easy-to-use digital identity is a prerequisite for being able to participate in the blockchain. There are still many questions open about the concept of digital identity. RvIG recently organized an internal blockchain workshop. One of the most appealing examples of 'identity in the blockchain' that came up was the do-it-yourself marriage. For the conclusion of a marriage, three parties are now needed: the two partners who decide to marry and the registrar of the civil registry who closes the marriage. The civil registrar's role is that of the 'third party that creates trust and can conclude the agreement after checking.' The nature of the blockchain means that this 'third party' is in some cases superfluous. In theory, this could also apply to a marriage: via the blockchain, the identity and intention of the two partners can be checked and verified via smart contracts and the decentralized databases. The marriage could thus be completed via the blockchain.",

The Child Package is a budget for children of parents with a minimum income. In the municipality of Zuidhorn about 150 children are eligible for the program. This money is used by the municipality for disadvantaged children, giving them the opportunity to participate in social activities, in sports and cultural activities at school. The municipality carries out this national assignment with local entrepreneurs and associations. Within the city, two students have been engaged in research into the possible applications of blockchain in municipal services. They have designed the implementation of the Kindpakket in a new and very user-friendly way with blockchain. The recipient of the Kindpakket can take out the purchase in a simple administrative and financial manner. The 'customer' pays, for example buying a bicycle, with a specific code and the entrepreneur gets the money directly into his account with no intervention from the municipality.",

        "description": "Novel payment models will enable HM Treasury (HMT) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to distribute welfare support more efficiently and improve policy delivery. By applying DLTs in the registration and payment processes for government grants and benefits, DWP will be better equipped to: (1) Prevent financial losses through fraud and error, (2) Support the most vulnerable citizens by offering them the benefits of full financial inclusion, (3) Support the achievement of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wider policy objectives, especially getting people out of poverty in a sustainable way and (4) Offer good value for money and place public expenditure on a sustainable footing. A large number of welfare claimants are un- or under-banked and face barriers to greater financial inclusion such as credit checks, access to traditional financial products, and the costs of unauthorised transactions. DLTs offer a cheap and supportive means of getting these claimants into the benefits system. Digital identities could be confirmed through distributed ledgers running on securely-encoded devices \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or even through software on a mobile device \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which would allow end-users to receive benefits directly, at reduced transaction costs to banks or local authorities. This may allow them to become more fully included in the financial system through a secure distribution point that is more reliable than a bank account. Such a solution could also be linked with other systems to reduce the level of fraud and official error in the delivery of benefits, as identities would be more difficult to forge. Such activities may help to achieve one of the DWP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal policy objectives: to lift people sustainably out of the cycle of poverty and state dependence. Through the innovative application of such technologies, it would be possible \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with agreement from the benefit claimant in question \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to set rules at both the recipient and merchant ends of welfare transactions. This may present the opportunity for ministers to consider options for achieving better policy outcomes from the distribution of welfare support by agreeing or setting rules around the use of benefits.",

However, it does want the replacement for its aging real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system to be ready for whatever the industry is likely to throw at it when it goes into service in 2020. It identified five key strategic drivers for the new RTGS system in a consultation document, \"A new RTGS service for the U.K.: safeguarding stability, enabling innovation\". Among them, it lists the need to interface with new technologies such as distributed ledgers. These are often referred to as blockchains, and include systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum. In the bank's view, these systems -- and, indeed, the entire concept of distributed ledgers -- are still in their infancy, but if they achieve critical mass, it wants to be ready for them.",

Undocumented children are easy prey for traffickers using fake documents to transport them across borders to work in brothels or to sell their organs. ConsenSys aimed to create a secure, digital identity on a blockchain - or decentralized digital ledger shared by a network of computers - for Moldovan children, linking their personal identities with other family members. With the blockchain system, children attempting to cross the border would be asked to scan their eyes or fingerprints. A phone alert would notify their legal guardians, requiring at least two to approve the crossing.",

The Proof of Concept allowed Medicalchain to gather feedback from doctors and patients that they will use to refine the programme before its global launch. Groves\u2019 registered patients were be able to create a free wallet that will hold and manage access to their health records. Video consultations were also be available to patients, offering the flexibility to see their doctor at a time and place suited to their needs. The platform gives patients the option to pay for services using cryptocurrency, with users being incentivised to pay for telemedicine services with Medicalchain\u2019s MedTokens.",

        "description": "For two years the Finnish Immigration Service has been giving asylum seekers who don\u2019t have bank accounts prepaid Mastercards instead of the traditional cash disbursements, and today the program has several thousand active cardholders. Developed by the Helsinki-based startup MONI, the card is also linked to a unique digital identity stored on a blockchain. This technology helps unbanked asylum seekers advance because what is typically keeping them from getting bank accounts and jobs is that they are missing a form of strongly authenticated identity. MONI\u2019s technology uses one of a number of public blockchains as the means of transferring value\u2014but in a way that to the users seems like using a debit card. A cardholder can pay for things at Mastercard terminals, or enter a number into a Web form to make payments online. MONI takes care of the cryptographic handshake necessary to execute the digital currency transaction as well as the conversion from digital currency back to fiat currency.",

You can use this platform to transfer pensions rights much more quickly and simply \u2013 and safely. This application searches for pensions for you and immediately gives you the option of looking at a proposal for transferring the value. All the main elements are covered in the proposal, letting you make a proper comparison between the two pensions arrangements. The platform has been developed with a modular structure that allows the administrative systems of pensions sector parties to be connected together. After a technology assessment was carried out, a combination of proven technology (such as databases and cloud infrastructure) combined with distributed ledger technology (DLT) was chosen for implementing the pension rights transfer platform. DLT is essentially a kind of records system that the information can be stored in. In this case, DLT is only part of the overall solution and is used specifically where it can add value, namely in creating a shared understanding for the parties.",

On one hand onnect man and machine using the latest generation interconnected sensors (IoT); on the other hand , the use of blockchain guarantees the immutability of the data,  the measurement of sustainable action and therefore the generation of the value attributed to it. The process is the result of a simple sequence of actions: the citizen creates his own profile with an associated wallet, then interfaces with the municipal waste collector and enters the waste to be recycled. At that point the collector measures the amount of waste and generates EcoCoin , which the citizen will spend in the affiliated circuits within the Municipality.",

If any of the organizations involved had an incentive to manipulate the attendance numbers, a paper attendee list is very susceptible to fraud. Blockchain technology can offer a solution to this problem with the\u2028development of the Self Sovereign Attendance App. With this app, based on IOTA, people can check in on a decentralized blockchain, which is immutable, transparent and cryptographically protected, so that only the authorized parties can access and see attendee data.

Despite being a proof of concept, the use case has been developed using the pre-production environments of the VALID and eTram services. The Validated ID VIDchain wallet was used in the project, which was the first to pass the EBSI trust certification.

        "description": "Universities do not have digital records for students especially for courses obtained across borders. This means that a large amount of manual work is needed. Tampere University in Finland & Kaunas University of Technology in Lithuania, are part of the university network ECIU, however, student accreditation such\u2028 as micro-credentials from courses (i.e. micro-modules or ECIU challenges) are not transferable between the two universities, making it very hard for students to take necessary courses abroad. Additionally, the current course accreditation system is missing any records of skills and\/or achievements acquired by the students. Both universities are taking leading positions towards building micro-accreditations standards. With such semantic models, universities across the EU could easily and in the uniform manner exchange academic information. Although, even having agreed a common data model there is still a need for a network or infrastructure that would allow the delivery of credentials that everyone can trust by default and be certain that they are authentic and legally binding. Moreover, such data transfer should address GDPR and EIDAS requirements, and students need to have mobility and interoperability. That is how it was decided to participate in the E BSI Early adopters Multi-university pilot. EBSI not only provides a trusted network by using blockchain technology, but ensures GDPR and EIDAS compliance and has a governance framework agreed between all Member States that ensures trust and reliability. The project team decided to use \u201cSelf Sovereign Identity\u201d or \u201cSSI\u201d to create transferable and verifiable micro credentials for students of both universities. This user-centric solution will allow students to hold records of their obtained courses, share these records and to have them verified by the university in which they\u2019d like to enroll.",
