catalog,10009,"AI Watch - Artificial Intelligence in public services. Overview of the use and impact of AI in public services in the EU",https://doi.org/10.2760/039619,,"This report is published in the context of AI Watch, the European Commission knowledge service to monitor the development, uptake and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Europe, launched in December 2018 as part of the Coordinated Plan on the Development and Use of AI Made in Europe. The report presents the results of the mapping of the use of AI in support of public services in the EU. The analysis serves to contribute landscaping the current state of the art in the field, and provide a preliminary overview of Member States efforts to integrate AI in their government operations and adopt AI-enabled innovations in the public sector. From the analysis it emerges that the interest on the use of AI within governments to support redesigning governance processes and policy-making mechanisms, as well as to improve public services delivery and engagement with citizens is growing. Governments across the EU are exploring the potential of AI use to improve policy design and evaluation, while reorganising the internal management of public administrations at all levels. Indeed, when used in a responsible way, the combination of new, large data sources with advanced machine learning algorithms could radically improve the operating methods of the public sector, thus paving the way to pro-active public service delivery models and relieving resource constrained organisations from mundane and repetitive tasks.","European Commission","European Union","Desk research",2020

catalog,10015,"A multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the innovation potential of digital public services: A step towards building an Innovative Public Services Observatory in the EU",https://doi.org/10.2760/09628,,"This report presents the main findings of a study conducted by KPMG under supervision of JRC and DIGIT as part of the “Innovative Public Services” (IPS) Action of the ISA² Programme. The main outcome of the research is an original multi-dimensional framework for evaluating the interoperability readiness of digital public services. The framework was conceptualised and tested in the context of desk and field research on available evidence to support European Public Administrations willing to embrace new digital technologies and deliver innovative public services according to the four layers of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and in alignment with the user centricity principles defined in the Tallinn Declaration (2017). The results of the research show that organisational and legal aspects not only need to support the digital transformation but they must be in its core as an essential part of the next EU Governments Interoperability Strategy, so to guarantee adoption of innovative public services and societal impact. The framework proposed in this report, and validated against a number of concrete cases and promising pilots in EU Member States, serve to evaluate the innovation potential of digital services in terms of their comprehensive interoperability and user-centricity dimensions. It thus pave the way to further assess the potential feasibility to set up an EU Innovative Public Services Observatory (IPSO) as part of the cooperation between the Commission and Member States within the context of the Digital Europe programme.","European Commission","European Union","Desk research",2020
