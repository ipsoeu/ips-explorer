Joinup - Architecture for public services chatbots,"To facilitate the access of citizens and business to public services, a large number of e-catalogues and e-Government portals have been implemented throughout Europe. In many cases the development of these catalogues has not been harmonised. This makes it difficult for public administrations, citizens and businesses to have an integrated view on life events, business events and the public services provided within a specific country or region. In this context, this document aims to identify how public administrations can best provide public services via chatbots.
