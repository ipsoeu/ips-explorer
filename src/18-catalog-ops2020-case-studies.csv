OSP2020 - Case studies,"Our Public Service 2020 is the framework for development and innovation in Irelandâ€™s public service. It was preceded by two public service reform plans beginning in 2011. These plans have embedded a range of new approaches to governance, people management and service delivery, and have made the work of the public service more transparent, decision-making more accountable, and service delivery more effective.",,https://www.ops2020.gov.ie/what-is-ops2020/case-studies/,Department of Public Expenditure and Reform,Ireland,Catalogue,2021
