  <h1>Welcome to IPS-X explore</h1>
  <p> The Innovative Public Services Explorer aimed to provide an integrated view of public services using emerging and innovative technologies. This initiative has now moved to an end and the results converged into Public Sector Tech Watch.</p>

  <p>Public Sector Tech Watch (PSTW) is an observatory of the European Commission dedicated to monitoring, analysing and disseminating the use of emerging technologies (e.g., Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, etc.) within the public sector in Europe 
    and it aims to become the “one stop” for all stakeholders – public sector officials, policy makers, private companies, academia – interested on the latest technological developments to improve public sector operations 
    and service delivery. PSTW is managed by the European Commission.</p>
