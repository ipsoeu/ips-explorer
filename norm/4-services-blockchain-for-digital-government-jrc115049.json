        "description": "In October 2017, the Maltese government has launched a project that develops academic credentials verification using blockchain technology. The Ministry for Education and Employment (MEDE) of Malta decided to use the Blockcerts open standard for management of academic records. Blockcerts provides all aspects of the value chain: creation, issuing, viewing, and verification of the certificates, and uses blockchain technology as the infrastructure. The pilot was initiated to create a verifiable proof of education for citizens.",

The project was initiated in September 2016 by the Swedish Mapping, Cadaster and Land Registration Authority, Landshypotek Bank, SBAB, Telia, Chromaway and Kairos Future. The project was set-up to redefine real estate transactions and mortgage deeds.",

Promotion of inclusivity in the city via a voucher system started in 1994. Up until 2013 vouchers were completely paper-based. In 2016 the voucher system in Groningen was moved to a blockchain, developed by DutchChain, a technology provider company. The core value-added of the blockchain-based system is the enhanced targeting of public money thanks to programmable money flows. Detailed spending conditions and eligibility criteria are programmed in the smart contract. Possible criteria include: detailed profiles of the beneficiaries and authorized providers, financial thresholds or usage limits. Smart vouchers can be used, for example, in sport clubs, cinemas or for subsidization of solar panels for home owners. From the municipality perspective Stadjerspas ensures that public money reserved for a specified purpose is spent exclusively on that purpose and targeted at a desired group of beneficiaries.",
