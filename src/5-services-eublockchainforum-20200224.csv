785,i-Voting,Governance and voting,https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/,,"i-Voting is a unique solution that simply and conveniently helps to engage people in the governance process. In 2005, Estonia became the first country in the world to hold nation-wide elections using this method, and in 2007, it made headlines as the first country to use i-Voting in parliamentary elections. Internet voting, or i-Voting, is a system that allows voters to cast their ballots from any internet-connected computer anywhere in the world. Completely unrelated to the electronic voting systems used elsewhere, which involve costly and problematic machinery, the Estonian solution is simple, elegant and secure. During a designated pre-voting period, the voter logs onto the system using an ID-card or Mobile-ID, and casts a ballot. The voter’s identity is removed from the ballot before it reaches the National Electoral Commission for counting, thereby ensuring anonymity. With any method of remote voting, including traditional postal ballots, the possibility of votes being forced or bought is a concern. Estonia’s solution was to allow voters to log on and vote as many times as they want during the pre-voting period. Since each vote cancels the last, a voter always has the option of changing his or her vote later.

Should the project prove successful it would become the world’s first blockchain-based trading system for wholesale energy. Vattenfall’s Business Area Markets division will conduct the pilot in order to deepen its understanding of the technology and conclude whether or not such a decentralised solution could match its existing trading platforms while simultaneously reducing cost. The trial will be managed by Hamburg-based B2B solutions provider Ponton, which will provide software that facilitates encrypted sending and receipt of orders through a decentralised order book.

R3 said on Tuesday that it had developed a prototype of the system together with the Financial Conduct Authority, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and another global bank which did not wish to be named. The system, which was built using R3’s blockchain called Corda, enables banks to generate automated delivery receipts for the regulator each time a mortgage is booked. The organizations hope that it can reduce the cost of the process and the risk of error. The FCA prototype “can give the regulator a new tool capable of overseeing mortgage activity much more quickly and efficiently than before whilst greatly reducing data inconsistencies,” Richard Crook, head of emerging technology at RBS, said in a statement.",National,United Kingdom,Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),Governmental,2017,Yes,,Financial and fiscal affairs,Control and monitoring,No,No,Blockchain,In development,Unknown
837,GovCoin Proof of Concept,Process digitisation,http://www.cityam.com/245128/government-has-quietly-been-testing-blockchain-technology,,"Novel payment models will enable HM Treasury (HMT) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to distribute welfare support more efficiently and improve policy delivery. By applying DLTs in the registration and payment processes for government grants and benefits, DWP will be better equipped to: (1) Prevent financial losses through fraud and error, (2) Support the most vulnerable citizens by offering them the benefits of full financial inclusion, (3) Support the achievement of the government’s wider policy objectives, especially getting people out of poverty in a sustainable way and (4) Offer good value for money and place public expenditure on a sustainable footing. A large number of welfare claimants are un- or under-banked and face barriers to greater financial inclusion such as credit checks, access to traditional financial products, and the costs of unauthorised transactions. DLTs offer a cheap and supportive means of getting these claimants into the benefits system. Digital identities could be confirmed through distributed ledgers running on securely-encoded devices — or even through software on a mobile device — which would allow end-users to receive benefits directly, at reduced transaction costs to banks or local authorities. This may allow them to become more fully included in the financial system through a secure distribution point that is more reliable than a bank account. Such a solution could also be linked with other systems to reduce the level of fraud and official error in the delivery of benefits, as identities would be more difficult to forge. Such activities may help to achieve one of the DWP’s principal policy objectives: to lift people sustainably out of the cycle of poverty and state dependence. Through the innovative application of such technologies, it would be possible — with agreement from the benefit claimant in question — to set rules at both the recipient and merchant ends of welfare transactions. This may present the opportunity for ministers to consider options for achieving better policy outcomes from the distribution of welfare support by agreeing or setting rules around the use of benefits.",National,United Kingdom,Department of Work and Pensions,Governmental,2016,Yes,,Social protection,Financial support,Yes,No,Blockchain,In development,Unknown

However, it does want the replacement for its aging real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system to be ready for whatever the industry is likely to throw at it when it goes into service in 2020. It identified five key strategic drivers for the new RTGS system in a consultation document, ""A new RTGS service for the U.K.: safeguarding stability, enabling innovation"". Among them, it lists the need to interface with new technologies such as distributed ledgers. These are often referred to as blockchains, and include systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum. In the bank's view, these systems -- and, indeed, the entire concept of distributed ledgers -- are still in their infancy, but if they achieve critical mass, it wants to be ready for them.",National,United Kingdom,Bank of England,Governmental,2017,Yes,,Financial and fiscal affairs,Other,Yes,No,Blockchain,In development,Unknown
