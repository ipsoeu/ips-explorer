        "description": "i-Voting is a unique solution that simply and conveniently helps to engage people in the governance process. In 2005, Estonia became the first country in the world to hold nation-wide elections using this method, and in 2007, it made headlines as the first country to use i-Voting in parliamentary elections. Internet voting, or i-Voting, is a system that allows voters to cast their ballots from any internet-connected computer anywhere in the world. Completely unrelated to the electronic voting systems used elsewhere, which involve costly and problematic machinery, the Estonian solution is simple, elegant and secure. During a designated pre-voting period, the voter logs onto the system using an ID-card or Mobile-ID, and casts a ballot. The voter\u2019s identity is removed from the ballot before it reaches the National Electoral Commission for counting, thereby ensuring anonymity. With any method of remote voting, including traditional postal ballots, the possibility of votes being forced or bought is a concern. Estonia\u2019s solution was to allow voters to log on and vote as many times as they want during the pre-voting period. Since each vote cancels the last, a voter always has the option of changing his or her vote later. In the case of i-Voting, the cumulative time saved in the last Estonian elections was 11,000 working days.",

Estonia\u2019s e-solution environment includes a full range of services for the general public, and since each service has its own databases they all use X-Road. To ensure secure transfers, all outgoing data from X-Road is digitally signed and encrypted, and all incoming data is authenticated and logged. Originally X-Road was simply used to send queries to different databases. Now it has developed into a tool that can also write to multiple databases, transmit large data sets and perform searches across several databases simultaneously. X-Road was designed with growth in mind, so it can be scaled up as new e-services and new platforms come online.",

Since (digital) identity is a broader and complex topic, the scope of the project was brought back to 4 user stories, one of them being age control while purchasing specific goods, such as cigarettes or alcohol. A particular advantage of Blockchain in relation to digital identity could be that it becomes easier to share specific information only in a specific context. Furthermore, each citizen would have control over which data he would share with whom (for obvious reasons, the exceptions can be made for governmental organisations). Going back to the age control, the owner of a shop only needs to know that the person in front of him is older than 18 years old, but currently (has to) ask for a document containing more data.",

The Chamber looked into the possible benefits of establishing a temporary organisation (FlashCompany) on the Blockchain. It found out that for the registration process (online), opening a bank account (can be linked automatically) and selecting conditions for establishing and ending the temporary organisation, Blockchain would be a viable solution. In addition, using smart contracts for donations (\u201cIf this video has 1000 views, I will donate 100 Euro\u201d) could be interesting.",

        "description": "In this second round of blockchain pilots with the government, we looked at and co-designed with a pilot from the municipality of Eindhoven. The Department does not only register ownership of real estate, but also registers and provides geo-information data. Sometimes the data is used in the wrong context, or an outdated set is accidentally used. By applying the blockchain, the Kadaster can immediately specify the most up-to-date dataset by means of a timestamp. It can then be used when filling in a form for environmental law requirements as well as other use cases. All participants can then establish that the data is up-to-date and correct. Providing these open data sets within the blockchain is not a very complicated process, but is therefore suitable to use to build a first blockchain prototype. The Kadaster is also researching work from other countries that are already experimenting with the blockchain and is looking to apply certain elements in the Netherlands.",

        "description": "The municipalities of Barendrecht, Albrandswaard and Ridderkerk's BAR Organization looked into ways in which they could apply blockchain to various permitting processes such as street parties. The BAR organization looked at small-scale events where someone applies for a license for a street party. Currently, the permit application is submitted to the municipality, but must be checked by several authorities, such as the fire department or police to approve or deny the permit based on feasibility. All these control moments and advice are again collected by the municipality and then it is checked whether the event permit can be issued. With the pilot team and experts, the BAR organization tried to model this process on the blockchain automating standard procedures with smart contracts. An additional advantage is that all involved agencies are now also immediately aware of each other's advice and any objections, without intervention of the municipality. Both matters mean a huge reduction in the burden on the work within the municipality. Everything can be done faster and the procedure becomes less vulnerable because a large part of the communication is no longer necessary.",

The city believes apparent that organization of the waste processing in the blockchain could bring many benefits. Specifically, the way in which waste weight per empty container is registered. In the pilot, the waste weight data is linked to that of the transporters, intermediaries and final processors, and organized via the blockchain. All these parties keep their own administration. Blockchain can contribute to a joint administration that provides absolute certainty about the integrity of the data. Another big advantage is that a number of control moments are automatically controlled via smart contracts. At the same time, we have insight into the entire process from waste container to final processor.",

        "description": "Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (RvIG) is investigating how digital identity can be implemented on blockchains for Dutch citizens According to RvIG, a reliable, easy-to-use digital identity is a prerequisite for being able to participate in the blockchain. There are still many questions open about the concept of digital identity. RvIG recently organized an internal blockchain workshop. One of the most appealing examples of 'identity in the blockchain' that came up was the do-it-yourself marriage. For the conclusion of a marriage, three parties are now needed: the two partners who decide to marry and the registrar of the civil registry who closes the marriage. The civil registrar's role is that of the 'third party that creates trust and can conclude the agreement after checking.' The nature of the blockchain means that this 'third party' is in some cases superfluous. In theory, this could also apply to a marriage: via the blockchain, the identity and intention of the two partners can be checked and verified via smart contracts and the decentralized databases. The marriage could thus be completed via the blockchain.",

The Child Package is a budget for children of parents with a minimum income. In the municipality of Zuidhorn about 150 children are eligible for the program. This money is used by the municipality for disadvantaged children, giving them the opportunity to participate in social activities, in sports and cultural activities at school. The municipality carries out this national assignment with local entrepreneurs and associations. Within the city, two students have been engaged in research into the possible applications of blockchain in municipal services. They have designed the implementation of the Kindpakket in a new and very user-friendly way with blockchain. The recipient of the Kindpakket can take out the purchase in a simple administrative and financial manner. The 'customer' pays, for example buying a bicycle, with a specific code and the entrepreneur gets the money directly into his account with no intervention from the municipality.",

        "description": "Novel payment models will enable HM Treasury (HMT) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to distribute welfare support more efficiently and improve policy delivery. By applying DLTs in the registration and payment processes for government grants and benefits, DWP will be better equipped to: (1) Prevent financial losses through fraud and error, (2) Support the most vulnerable citizens by offering them the benefits of full financial inclusion, (3) Support the achievement of the government\u2019s wider policy objectives, especially getting people out of poverty in a sustainable way and (4) Offer good value for money and place public expenditure on a sustainable footing. A large number of welfare claimants are un- or under-banked and face barriers to greater financial inclusion such as credit checks, access to traditional financial products, and the costs of unauthorised transactions. DLTs offer a cheap and supportive means of getting these claimants into the benefits system. Digital identities could be confirmed through distributed ledgers running on securely-encoded devices \u2014 or even through software on a mobile device \u2014 which would allow end-users to receive benefits directly, at reduced transaction costs to banks or local authorities. This may allow them to become more fully included in the financial system through a secure distribution point that is more reliable than a bank account. Such a solution could also be linked with other systems to reduce the level of fraud and official error in the delivery of benefits, as identities would be more difficult to forge. Such activities may help to achieve one of the DWP\u2019s principal policy objectives: to lift people sustainably out of the cycle of poverty and state dependence. Through the innovative application of such technologies, it would be possible \u2014 with agreement from the benefit claimant in question \u2014 to set rules at both the recipient and merchant ends of welfare transactions. This may present the opportunity for ministers to consider options for achieving better policy outcomes from the distribution of welfare support by agreeing or setting rules around the use of benefits.",

The bank is not suggesting that U.K. banks should begin processing bitcoin payments as a matter of routine. However, it does want the replacement for its aging real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system to be ready for whatever the industry is likely to throw at it when it goes into service in 2020. It identified five key strategic drivers for the new RTGS system in a consultation document, \"A new RTGS service for the U.K.: safeguarding stability, enabling innovation,\" published Friday. Among them, it lists the need to interface with new technologies such as distributed ledgers. These are often referred to as blockchains, and include systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum. In the bank's view, these systems -- and, indeed, the entire concept of distributed ledgers -- are still in their infancy, but if they achieve critical mass, it wants to be ready for them.",

        "description": "The U.K.\u2019s Food Standards Agency (FSA), a safety watchdog, has successfully piloted a blockchain-based supply chain monitoring system. The trial tracked meat produced in an unnamed cattle slaughterhouse, providing \u201cimproved transparency\u201d throughout the supply chain, according to a press release. Both the slaughterhouse and the FSA tracked data provided in the trial.\u201cOur approach has been to develop data standards with industry that will make theory reality and I\u2019m delighted that we\u2019ve been able to show that blockchain does indeed work in this part of the food industry. I think there are great opportunities now for industry and government to work together to expand and develop this approach.\u201d",
