The project was initiated in September 2016 by the Swedish Mapping, Cadaster and Land Registration Authority, Landshypotek Bank, SBAB, Telia, Chromaway and Kairos Future.

In 2016 the voucher system in Groningen was moved to a blockchain, developed by DutchChain, a technology provider company. The core value-added of the blockchain-based system is the enhanced targeting of public money thanks to programmable money flows. Detailed spending conditions and eligibility criteria are programmed in the smart contract. Possible criteria include: detailed profiles of the beneficiaries and authorized providers, financial thresholds or usage limits. Smart vouchers can be used, for example, in sport clubs, cinemas or for subsidization of solar panels for home owners.

In 2005, Estonia became the first country in the world to hold nation-wide elections using this method, and in 2007, it made headlines as the first country to use i-Voting in parliamentary elections. Internet voting, or i-Voting, is a system that allows voters to cast their ballots from any internet-connected computer anywhere in the world. Completely unrelated to the electronic voting systems used elsewhere, which involve costly and problematic machinery, the Estonian solution is simple, elegant and secure. During a designated pre-voting period, the voter logs onto the system using an ID-card or Mobile-ID, and casts a ballot. The voter\u2019s identity is removed from the ballot before it reaches the National Electoral Commission for counting, thereby ensuring anonymity. With any method of remote voting, including traditional postal ballots, the possibility of votes being forced or bought is a concern. Estonia\u2019s solution was to allow voters to log on and vote as many times as they want during the pre-voting period. Since each vote cancels the last, a voter always has the option of changing his or her vote later. In the case of i-Voting, the cumulative time saved in the last Estonian elections was 11,000 working days.",

Since (digital) identity is a broader and complex topic, the scope of the project was brought back to 4 user stories, one of them being age control while purchasing specific goods, such as cigarettes or alcohol. A particular advantage of Blockchain in relation to digital identity could be that it becomes easier to share specific information only in a specific context. Furthermore, each citizen would have control over which data he would share with whom (for obvious reasons, the exceptions can be made for governmental organisations). Going back to the age control, the owner of a shop only needs to know that the person in front of him is older than 18 years old, but currently (has to) ask for a document containing more data.",

        "description": "In The Netherlands, minors can get a so-called HALT sentence for committing (minor) crimes. This sentence means that the minor has to do labour. When the work gets completed, the minor no longer has criminal record. The project team looked into the possibilities to use Blockchain for the registration of labour that has been completed. Blockchain would be an interesting technology for such a log, but important legal questions need to be resolved. For example, would it be legally allowed to store information on a Blockchain permanently if the point of getting a HALT sentence is that the minor can continue his life without a criminal record?",

The Department does not only register ownership of real estate, but also registers and provides geo-information data. Sometimes the data is used in the wrong context, or an outdated set is accidentally used. By applying the blockchain, the Kadaster can immediately specify the most up-to-date dataset by means of a timestamp. It can then be used when filling in a form for environmental law requirements as well as other use cases. All participants can then establish that the data is up-to-date and correct. Providing these open data sets within the blockchain is not a very complicated process, but is therefore suitable to use to build a first blockchain prototype.

        "description": "The municipalities of Barendrecht, Albrandswaard and Ridderkerk's BAR Organization looked into ways in which they could apply blockchain to various permitting processes such as street parties. The BAR organization looked at small-scale events where someone applies for a license for a street party. Currently, the permit application is submitted to the municipality, but must be checked by several authorities, such as the fire department or police to approve or deny the permit based on feasibility. All these control moments and advice are again collected by the municipality and then it is checked whether the event permit can be issued. With the pilot team and experts, the BAR organization tried to model this process on the blockchain automating standard procedures with smart contracts. An additional advantage is that all involved agencies are now also immediately aware of each other's advice and any objections, without intervention of the municipality. Both matters mean a huge reduction in the burden on the work within the municipality. Everything can be done faster and the procedure becomes less vulnerable because a large part of the communication is no longer necessary.",

The city believes apparent that organisation of the waste processing in the blockchain could bring many benefits. Specifically, the way in which waste weight per empty container is registered. In the pilot, the waste weight data is linked to that of the transporters, intermediaries and final processors, and organized via the blockchain. All these parties keep their own administration. Blockchain can contribute to a joint administration that provides absolute certainty about the integrity of the data. Another big advantage is that a number of control moments are automatically controlled via smart contracts.

        "description": "Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (RvIG) is investigating how digital identity can be implemented on blockchains for Dutch citizens According to RvIG, a reliable, easy-to-use digital identity is a prerequisite for being able to participate in the blockchain. There are still many questions open about the concept of digital identity. RvIG recently organized an internal blockchain workshop. One of the most appealing examples of 'identity in the blockchain' that came up was the do-it-yourself marriage. For the conclusion of a marriage, three parties are now needed: the two partners who decide to marry and the registrar of the civil registry who closes the marriage. The civil registrar's role is that of the 'third party that creates trust and can conclude the agreement after checking.' The nature of the blockchain means that this 'third party' is in some cases superfluous. In theory, this could also apply to a marriage: via the blockchain, the identity and intention of the two partners can be checked and verified via smart contracts and the decentralized databases. The marriage could thus be completed via the blockchain.",

The Child Package is a budget for children of parents with a minimum income. In the municipality of Zuidhorn about 150 children are eligible for the program. This money is used by the municipality for disadvantaged children, giving them the opportunity to participate in social activities, in sports and cultural activities at school. The municipality carries out this national assignment with local entrepreneurs and associations. Within the city, two students have been engaged in research into the possible applications of blockchain in municipal services. They have designed the implementation of the Kindpakket in a new and very user-friendly way with blockchain. The recipient of the Kindpakket can take out the purchase in a simple administrative and financial manner. The 'customer' pays, for example buying a bicycle, with a specific code and the entrepreneur gets the money directly into his account with no intervention from the municipality.",

        "description": "R3 CEV has partnered with Britain\u2019s financial watchdog and two large banks to develop a blockchain-based application to improve the regulatory reporting of mortgage transactions. R3 said on Tuesday that it had developed a prototype of the system together with the Financial Conduct Authority, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and another global bank which did not wish to be named. The system, which was built using R3\u2019s blockchain called Corda, enables banks to generate automated delivery receipts for the regulator each time a mortgage is booked. The organizations hope that it can reduce the cost of the process and the risk of error. The FCA prototype \u201ccan give the regulator a new tool capable of overseeing mortgage activity much more quickly and efficiently than before whilst greatly reducing data inconsistencies,\u201d Richard Crook, head of emerging technology at RBS, said in a statement.",

        "description": "Novel payment models will enable HM Treasury (HMT) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to distribute welfare support more efficiently and improve policy delivery. By applying DLTs in the registration and payment processes for government grants and benefits, DWP will be better equipped to: (1) Prevent financial losses through fraud and error, (2) Support the most vulnerable citizens by offering them the benefits of full financial inclusion, (3) Support the achievement of the government\u2019s wider policy objectives, especially getting people out of poverty in a sustainable way and (4) Offer good value for money and place public expenditure on a sustainable footing. A large number of welfare claimants are un- or under-banked and face barriers to greater financial inclusion such as credit checks, access to traditional financial products, and the costs of unauthorised transactions. DLTs offer a cheap and supportive means of getting these claimants into the benefits system. Digital identities could be confirmed through distributed ledgers running on securely-encoded devices \u2014 or even through software on a mobile device \u2014 which would allow end-users to receive benefits directly, at reduced transaction costs to banks or local authorities. This may allow them to become more fully included in the financial system through a secure distribution point that is more reliable than a bank account. Such a solution could also be linked with other systems to reduce the level of fraud and official error in the delivery of benefits, as identities would be more difficult to forge. Such activities may help to achieve one of the DWP\u2019s principal policy objectives: to lift people sustainably out of the cycle of poverty and state dependence. Through the innovative application of such technologies, it would be possible \u2014 with agreement from the benefit claimant in question \u2014 to set rules at both the recipient and merchant ends of welfare transactions. This may present the opportunity for ministers to consider options for achieving better policy outcomes from the distribution of welfare support by agreeing or setting rules around the use of benefits.",

The bank is not suggesting that U.K. banks should begin processing bitcoin payments as a matter of routine. However, it does want the replacement for its aging real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system to be ready for whatever the industry is likely to throw at it when it goes into service in 2020. It identified five key strategic drivers for the new RTGS system in a consultation document, \"A new RTGS service for the U.K.: safeguarding stability, enabling innovation\". Among them, it lists the need to interface with new technologies such as distributed ledgers. These are often referred to as blockchains, and include systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum. In the bank's view, these systems -- and, indeed, the entire concept of distributed ledgers -- are still in their infancy, but if they achieve critical mass, it wants to be ready for them.",

Sentilo is an open source sensor and actuator platform designed to fit in the Smart City architecture of any city who looks for openness and easy interoperability. It\u2019s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of cities and companies that believe that using open standards and free software is the first smart decision a Smart City should take. In order to avoid vertical solutions, Sentilo is designed as a cross platorm with the objective of sharing information between heterogeneous systems and to easily integrate legacy applications.",

One initial hypotheses on how this could be done is automated categorisation of the product types that are being procured.

Predictive analytics is used to decide where to send the police for traffic regulation. The system is well used in cities; however the algorithm does not yet work well in rural areas.  The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund matches job seekers with open positions using AI. It helps job seekers get matched with the right job. The current job matching algorithm is developed further with job seeker profiling algorithm.  Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board is using machine learning to detect land mowing. Satellite images are analysed to detect whether agricultural land has been mowed. This is necessary as mowing land is one of the requirements for receiving government grants. Before satellite image analysis this work was carried out manually using on-spot control.  In line with the Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia, the government encourages the use of AI applications and test projects. The aim is to have at least 50 use cases in public sector by 2020. Interestingly, Estonia has also launched a task force to collect ideas from the general public on how to best make use of AI for the development of Estonia's economy and state.",

        "description": "The Swedish municipality of Upplands-Bro has started experimenting with the robot Tengai in their recruitment processes since June 2019. Tengai is one of the first interviewer robots developed with the aim to make the recruitment process less biased than traditional interview practices would do. The robot is adopted by the recruitment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made their recruitment processes less biased. For the last 10 years already, the agency have not used resumes in their recruitment process and growingly taken an interest in data-driven recruitment tools. Consequently, having a physical robot was regarded as the next step in preventing biases in hiring decisions. The idea behind the use of the robot was to avoid that a human person was present at the beginning of the recruitment process in order to neutralise any psycho-social prejudices.",

        "description": "As early as in 2012, the Polish Ministry of Labour and Social Policy (MLSP) started working on the reform of 340 labour offices (PUP - Powiatowe Urz\u0119dy Pracy), charged with analysing the trends and supporting the development of the labour market. The urgency of the reform was underlined by a general perception of PUPs being inefficient, understaffed and unfit to address the challenges posed by the modern labour market. With that reform in mind - and without significant public spending increases at hand \u2013 the MLSP has scoped possible solutions that would ensure more efficient budget allocation. In this light, resorting to an automated profiling system for unemployment came across as a modern, cost efficient and individualized method of service delivery. The process of automated profiling divides unemployed persons in three categories, taking into consideration a number of individual characteristics. Assignment to a given category determines what types of programs a beneficiary is eligible for (e.g. job placement, vocational training, apprenticeship, activation allowance). The system is based on data collected during an initial interview (e.g.. age, gender, disability and duration of unemployment), and a subsequent computer-based test that scores 24 different dimensions. Assignment to one of the three profile groups indicates the needed level of support and resource burden. Importantly, in one case categorisation translates into life-changing, binary decisions: state support or lack thereof.",

The municipality sometimes receives reports, for instance from neighbours or rental platforms, who suspect that a home has been rented out without meeting those requirements. If such a report is filed, employees of the department of Surveillance & Enforcement can start an investigation. From 1 July 2020, a pilot will be carried out for six months with an algorithm that supports the employees of the department of Surveillance & Enforcement in their investigation of the reports made concerning possible illegal holiday rentals. The algorithm helps prioritize the reports so that the limited enforcement capacity can be used efficiently and effectively. By analyzing the data of related housing fraud cases of the past 5 years, it calculates the probability of an illegal holiday rental situation on the reported address.",

This system used to be a collection of drop-down menus, from which the user would pick the category that best suited their report. The department responsible for a certain category would then take care of the report. However, as the municipality is a complex organisation, there are countless categories. Many times the wrong category would be chosen, resulting in delays. Now, an algorithm recognizes certain keywords, for example, \u2018waste\u2019 and \u2018sidewalk\u2019. From these keywords, it determines which category it belongs to, and ultimately, which department within the municipality should examine the case. As a result, there are fewer administrative steps for the person reporting on the issue. Also, the report can be processed much faster, because it arrives at the right department more quickly.",

To help remind citizens to maintain this distance we have created the 1.5 meter monitor.  The 1.5 meter monitor is a system created to make users aware of social distancing measures. It uses a camera, computer with GPU (or edge devices) and a screen to create awareness for anybody within the field of view of the camera to keep social distance. It does so by displaying a picture that is taken of passersby, that is overlayed with a smiley: a green smiley for more than 1.8 meters distance, an orange smiley for 1.5-1.8 meters distance and a red one for less than 1.5 meters distance. An audio signal can also be played.  The system does not store any visual information, and when detected people will be displayed with a smiley overlay to prevent visual recognition. We do record the number of passers-by within range of the camera, to monitor whether it is too busy in a certain area.  We are using the 1.5 meter monitor temporarily because of the COVID-19 Emergency Ordinance and because of the need to keep a distance of 1.5 meters.

        "description": "IMMS (Intelligent Material Management System) is an intelligent material management system for the entire library collection. The City Library\u2019s collection contains approximately 1.8 million items. An intelligent material management system was acquired while the city library moved away from library-specific collections to one shared collection. With the change, the library wanted to enable moving the material freely between different libraries. The system was introduced in May 2019, after which it has been in use but still in the deployment phase. The system has made it possible to reach a situation where the majority of the collection now floats, i.e. moves freely between libraries. With the floating material, customers can influence the offering of each library with their own activities. Returns influence the offerings of libraries. Library experts can modify system configurations based on reports and observations. The aim is to distribute the new material equally so that no library is in an unequal position based on its size. Thus the customers of different libraries can be served in an equal manner. The service enables tracking and tracing of the item movements. The material can be located in real-time using RFID tags attached to the material. The material to be borrowed from the Helsinki City Library was labelled with RFID tags before the system was introduced. RFID tags are also used in transport units, check-out machines sorting points, and in special shelf identification. The library system is not intended for logistical tracking of material, and therefore this new system effectively complements the data obtained on the movement of items. Library experts can control the flow of material between libraries with parameters and rules supported by the system. These control the filling level of library shelves in a way that allows the better presentation of materials to customers. The material hotel created during the introduction of the intelligent material management system balances, for example, seasonal overflows and shelf overflow during library renovations. Guests do not have physical access to the material hotel, but the material can be booked. The material hotel is located in the Pasila library building, close to the city library\u2019s central sorter. Furthermore, the system also makes it possible to reduce manual logistics. The material can be processed, for example, by moving the reservations box by box, when this was previously done on an item by item basis. Improving the handling of reservations is necessary as the number of reservations has risen sharply in recent years. Improving the efficiency of processing also enables staff to allocate working hours from logistics to other library work. The service includes a mobile application used by library staff. With the help of the mobile application, the material can be transferred to the central sorter or to the library shelves, either box at a time or, if necessary, item at a time. It also allows staff to see item, shelf, or transport unit-specific information (current information, as well as the previous movements).The Danish Lyngsoe Systems have built the system in collaboration with Danish public libraries. The system only processes material data and not handle the personal data of customers at all.",

This can be achieved either by automating the telephony itself (optimization of a channel) or by adding additional communication channels to telephony (multi-channel approach, hybrid approach). While personal contact with an employee is usually necessary for specific problem solving, the simple provision of information and forwarding of information can also be implemented via other, more automated, channels. We follow the suggestions for action recommended in the study \u201cUniform telephone numbers for authorities in the European Union\u201d (IfG.CC, 2010) and formulate the project objective to increase the accessibility of D115 and to create expanded and combined access channels to information from authorities. In addition, the citizen assistant should use and promote the increasing digitalization of services of the Berlin administration. For this purpose, interfaces to services are integrated or created.
